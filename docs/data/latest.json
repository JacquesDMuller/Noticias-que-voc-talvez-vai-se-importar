      "content": "We live in a golden age of controllers. The gamepads on the market now are of higher quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from even one console generation ago. If you play games on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you have the unenviable task of choosing between several controllers from Microsoft as well as a plethora of great options from the likes of 8BitDo, PowerA, Razer, Scuf, GameSir, and Hyperkin. Some of them have drift-resistant Hall effect or TMR-based joysticks for improved longevity, yet all of them are good for one reason or another. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool but barely worked are over.\nThe best Xbox controller to buy right now\nFrom basic and affordable to premium and ultra-customizable, these are the best controllers we’ve tested for Xbox.\nFrom basic and affordable to premium and ultra-customizable, these are the best controllers we’ve tested for Xbox.\nWe’ve spent time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may not be a surprise that the standard Xbox Wireless Controller is the best option for most folks. It makes for a great PC and Steam Deck controller, too. The default Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, but there are several alternatives worth considering.\nFeatured Products\nWhat we’re looking for\nWe test Xbox controllers by playing with them for an extended period of time across a variety of genres. Our test targets include team-based arena games like Marvel Rivals, competitive shooters like Call of Duty, fighters like Tekken 8, and role-playing titles like Elden Ring. When doing so, we pay close attention to how all of the components feel. Are the triggers satisfying to pull? Do the analog sticks offer the right level of resistance? Are the D-pads and face buttons too mushy, or just right? If a controller includes customization options — such as adjustable trigger stops and sensitivity, and / or remappable back buttons — we test how easy they are to configure, then judge their impact on our gameplay experience.\nIs it wireless? Does it support Bluetooth? Or is it wired only? If so, is the cable replaceable?\nDoes it feel cheap or nicely made? Any glitches or reliability issues while testing?\nDoes it have handy extras, like remappable buttons or customizable triggers?\nCan you remap buttons or tune it with custom software profiles?\nIs it priced affordably, about average, or does it come at a steep premium?\nThe best Xbox controller for most people\nXbox Wireless Controller\nThe Good\n- Incredible value for Xbox Wireless support\n- Great ergonomic design\n- Satisfying buttons and triggers\nThe Bad\n- Lacks customization\n- Requires AA batteries (or an optional rechargeable cell)\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Power: AA batteries or add-on rechargeable\nOkay, I already know what you’re thinking. “The best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?” That may seem like a no-brainer, but this standard controller truly does earn this title as the best. It lacks some extras found on pricier options, but this controller is the distillation of all that has made the last 20 years of Xbox gamepads great, and it shows.\nThanks to Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol, the Xbox Wireless Controller is the only affordable wireless option out there. (Third-party wireless alternatives are available, but they’re mostly at the high end.) While some hate the standard Xbox wireless controller for its use of AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. And user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use. It also works over a USB-C wired connection.\nBut the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its varied connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $65 (and often less) asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you’ll probably be best served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like Hori’s Horipad Pro — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is otherwise an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.\nThe only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity (button remapping is available), though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its Xbox Design Lab, which bumps the price from $79.99 to $124.93 depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors that Microsoft offers.\nThe best cheap Xbox controller\n8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox\nThe Good\n- Inexpensive\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Satisfying buttons and Hall effect components\n- Programmable back buttons are easy to press\nThe Bad\n- Lacks trigger stops\nConnectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Wired\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox is a fantastic budget model that typically retails for $44.99 but can often be found for as little as $29.99. The shape is reminiscent of Nintendo’s Switch Pro Controller, only a bit smaller, with hints of Xbox influence and a curvaceous design that feels great to hold.\nOn the hardware front, the Ultimate Wired Controller features Hall effect sticks with satisfying tension. It also uses Hall effect triggers with dedicated vibration motors, though it lacks trigger stops, unlike our previous budget pick, the PowerA Advantage Wired. Its D-pad, face buttons, and bumpers are nice and clicky, too, despite being smaller than we’d typically like. It has two rear paddles, remappable buttons, and the ability to save up to three profiles, which you can switch between on the fly using a dedicated button. There’s even a built-in mute switch for audio, which isn’t common on cheaper controllers. You can download the 8BitDo Ultimate Software X app on PC or Xbox to fully customize this controller.\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired works as a wired controller with your PC, but if you prefer wireless connectivity, the company also makes a three-mode wireless version for $69.99 with support for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (via a dongle). The wireless version is a bit more expensive, however, and it’s still limited to wired connectivity on Xbox consoles.\nThe best “pro” Xbox controller\nXbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2\nThe Good\n- Extensive modular customization\n- Premium look and feel\n- Rechargeable battery lasts an incredible 40 hours\nThe Bad\n- Pricey\n- Questionable quality control\n- No Hall effect components\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Up to four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nThe Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is Microsoft’s fanciest controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and as a result, it just feels nicer in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $199.99 (or sometimes less, if it’s on sale).\nThere’s also the stripped-down Elite Series 2 “Core” version with an MSRP of $149.99, which ditches the add-ons but is equally customizable. You can buy them separately in a $59.99 accessories pack, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.\nA pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of a splurge purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels that require its high-end features. Nevertheless, it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your liking, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc., while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool or easy as when using an Elite.\nWhile the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of stick drift after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers).\nEven so, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.\nA formidable alternative to the Elite\nRazer Wolverine V3 Pro\nThe Good\n- Supports Xbox Wireless protocol\n- Hall effect sticks use replaceable tops\n- Four rear buttons smartly positioned for comfort\n- Two extra shoulder buttons add unique versatility\n- Trigger stops and back buttons offer a satisfying mouse-like click\nThe Bad\n- Expensive\n- Requires a USB dongle\n- Razer Synapse software needs work\nConnectivity: Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nAt $199.99, Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro controller is as expensive (or more, depending on available deals) than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, yielding a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours).\nOther than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.\nThe Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its more basic software customization, its lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its high price, which, unlike the Series 2, is rarely subjected to discounts. Luckily, if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired configuration.\nAn affordable alternative to the Elite\nGameSir’s G7 Pro is a wired Xbox controller with remapable rear buttons, adjustable triggers, and TMR joysticks. It can also be connected wirelessly to a PC (via a 2.4Ghz dongle) or Android (via Bluetooth).\nConnectivity: Wired (Xbox), wireless USB dongle (PC), Bluetooth (Android) / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nIf you don’t mind using a wired controller, GameSir’s G7 Pro offers some features of the splurge-worthy Xbox Elite Controller 2 for under $100. It has remappable buttons, smooth-feeling drift-resistant TMR control sticks, a satisfying weight, and textured grips that made it feel comfortable to hold even with sweaty palms.\nThe G7 Pro is actually a battery-powered wireless controller, but its cable free connectivity is limited to PC (via an included 2.4Ghz dongle) and Android (via Bluetooth). You’ll need to plug the controller into the Xbox with a cable, and GameSir provides a lengthy USB-C to USB-A cord. The cable was long enough that I could play games from my couch (roughly six feet away) without feeling tethered.\nI was impressed with the G7 Pro’s overall build quality, especially the triggers, which could be locked by flipping switches on its back. GameSir includes three swappable direction pads with the G7 Pro, which can be swapped by lifting the front of the controller’s shell and popping them in and out. However, its face buttons felt noticeably cheaper than the ones on the Elite 2, which makes sense given their price difference. Button feel aside, the controller never dropped an input, even when I mashed buttons to string together elaborate combos in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, or continuously cast spells, dodged, and healed in Diablo IV. If an action was mistimed, it was on me.\nWhat the controller lacks in face button quality is more than made up for in customizability. GameSir Nexus, a free app on the Xbox Store, allowed me to remap any button (including the L4 and R4 buttons on its backside), adjust the vibration intensity of both triggers, enable two flavors of hair trigger mode, and set the deadzone for each control stick. You can save up to four profiles with different settings, and quickly switch between them by pressing the controller’s M button along with one of the face buttons. You never need to touch these options, or even download the GameSir Nexus app for the G7 Pro to work, but doing so will unlock its full potential.\nThe GameSir G7 Pro is an excellent Xbox controller, especially in its price range. I’d have liked the option to use it wirelessly, but that wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. That said, it’s something to consider depending on how far away you are from your Xbox when playing. If you’re a multi-platform gamer and want a controller to use with both an Xbox and PC (or Android device), it’s an even better choice.\nThe best Xbox controller for multi-console gamers\nHyperkin’s Competitor is a wired Xbox controller that looks and feels like Sony’s PlayStation 5 DualSense gamepad. It has symmetrical Hall effect joysticks, four-button directional pad, and a pair of programmable back buttons.\nConnectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: No / Power: N/A\nHyperkin’s cheekily-named Competitor wired Xbox and PC-compatible controller that looks and feels like the DualSense gamepad that comes with the PlayStation 5 — aka one of the Xbox’s main competitors. The controller’s Hall effect joysticks are symmetrical and located at the bottom, while a four-button directional pad sits above the left grip. The giant “X” button in the middle of the controller is an immediate giveaway that you’re using an Xbox gamepad, but it was easy to forget I wasn’t using a DualSense when playing games.\nIn terms of comfort the Competitor was on par with Microsoft’s official Xbox Wireless Controller. I’ve played enough PlayStation games over the years that using the gamepad felt intuitive, with no need to adjust my muscle memory, or change my grip. Playing with a wired controller can feel restrictive, but the long USB-C to USB-A cable included with the Competitor prevented me from feeling tethered. The cable is replaceable, which is good news if yours gets frayed or otherwise damaged over time.\nOverall, I was pleased with the controller’s construction. It was heavy enough to feel substantial, but light enough that I never felt wrist fatigue after holding it for an hour or more. Its buttons were all satisfyingly clickey, and its joysticks glided smoothly. The controller has two programmable back buttons, which you can program by pressing one of the rear buttons and the “M” button that’s also located on the controller’s backside. The controller rumbles to let you know it’s time to press another button on the controller to set the hot key. Each back button has to be programmed one at a time, and can be disabled by flipping a switch.\nMy tests included playing Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, Crash Bandicoot 4, Trials of Mana, and Tales of Arise. I had no problems jumping (or skating as it were) into any of these games. Playing them felt intuitive, and the controller never dropped an input. A benefit to playing games with a wired controller is there’s less latency between when you press a button and an action happens on screen. The difference is generally imperceptible (unless you play online games competitively), but there were probably a couple of Tony Hawk combos I nailed in the nick of time thanks to the lower latency.\nMy personal preference will always be to play Xbox games with a wireless controller because it’s the least restrictive type of gamepad. However, Hyperkin’s Competitor is a great gamepad in general, and an especially good choice if you’re regularly switching between playing Xbox, PC, and PS5 games. It doesn’t offer the same amount of customization as the GameSir G7 or Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, but its design and $49.99 MSRP more than make up for those shortcomings.\nOther Xbox controllers to consider\n- The Scuf Valor Pro is the company’s first Xbox controller with Hall effect sticks, as well as its cheapest at $109.99. Scuf emulates Microsoft’s winning ergonomics while implementing redesigned remappable rear buttons (two are removable) and shoulder bumpers that are more comfortable to reach. It also has trigger stops that produce a satisfying click with next to no travel when pressed. The D-pad produces a similarly satisfying click, one we prefer over the softer tactile feel of the Instinct. The Valor Pro is not the most exciting controller on paper, but it’s a solid option for Scuf faithful or anyone who wants more durable analog sticks. Read our hands-on impressions.\n- We tested PowerA’s latest pro-style Xbox controllers, including the Fusion Pro 4 Wired ($79.99) and PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless ($169.99). They’re standard fare for pro-style controllers these days, with height-adjustable Hall effect sticks, four remappable rear buttons, three-way trigger locks, and onboard volume controls. They’re similar, but the Pro Wireless has four trippy Lumectra lighting zones that respond to your button presses. Both controllers are satisfying to use and a clear step up from PowerA’s older products in terms of overall quality, but they ultimately don’t stand out much at these price points.\nWhat’s coming next\n- At CES 2026, 8BitDo unveiled its second officially licensed wireless Xbox controller, the $149.99 Ultimate 3E. It isn’t coming until Q2, but there are reasons to get excited, especially if you like to customize your gamepads. The new model features swappable ABXY buttons, and you can also swap out the joysticks and D-pad for others included with each purchase. It offers TMR joysticks, Hall effect triggers, and a pair of rear bumpers. It connects to Xbox via the included 2.4GHz USB dongle, though it also supports Bluetooth for connecting to Apple and Android devices.\nUpdate, January 28th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and add a mention of 8BitDo’s forthcoming Ultimate 3E controller.

      "content": "Dia da Proteção de Dados: como proteger informações em dispositivos móveis\nEspecialistas apontam que os dispositivos móveis se tornaram um dos principais focos de risco para as informações pessoais\nNesta quarta-feira, 28, o Dia Internacional da Proteção de Dados Pessoais convida à reflexão sobre como as informações privadas são protegidas em um ambiente cada vez mais digitalizado.\nDiante de um cenário de mudanças, os dispositivos móveis, que armazenam dados bancários, credenciais de trabalho, conversas e conteúdos pessoais, tornaram-se um dos pontos mais críticos para a privacidade.\nComo a evolução da IA exige maior proteção de dados?\nA rápida evolução da inteligência artificial aumentou a sofisticação dos ataques, facilitando o acesso indevido a dados pessoais e expondo tanto usuários quanto organizações a riscos crescentes de vazamentos e fraudes.\nEsse cenário é especialmente desafiador para o Brasil. Somente no primeiro semestre de 2025, o país concentrou 315 bilhões de tentativas de ataques cibernéticos, o que representa 84% do volume total registrado na América Latina, segundo dados apresentados no evento Fortinet Cybersecurity Summit Brasil, em agosto de 2025.\nA exposição de dados pessoais é agravada pelo uso de inteligência artificial generativa na criação de malwares e campanhas de phishing cada vez mais personalizadas, capazes de enganar até mesmo usuários experientes.\nEssas técnicas automatizadas reduzem o tempo de execução dos ataques e ampliam seu alcance, aumentando os riscos para a privacidade, especialmente em organizações que adotam modelos de trabalho remoto.\nCom mais de 70% dos incidentes associados a falhas humanas, a proteção dos dispositivos a partir dos quais se acessam dados pessoais tornou-se um fator-chave para a continuidade dos negócios e o cumprimento da LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados).\n“A tecnologia nos trouxe múltiplas formas de nos conectarmos e acessarmos nossas informações pessoais por meio de dispositivos móveis, mas também ampliou as vulnerabilidades. Proteger esses equipamentos já não é opcional; é uma condição essencial para resguardar os dados pessoais e a privacidade, tanto no âmbito individual quanto corporativo”, afirma Catarina Viegas, CEO da Cipher para a América Latina.\nNesse contexto, a executiva destaca que a inteligência artificial também pode ser uma aliada na proteção de dados. “A mesma tecnologia que hoje potencializa os ataques também fortalece as defesas. Na Cipher, utilizamos analítica avançada e monitoramento contínuo para antecipar comportamentos anômalos antes que se transformem em um vazamento de dados pessoais”, explica Viegas.\nEstado de vigília constante\nEm um mundo onde a fronteira entre o físico e o digital praticamente desapareceu, a segurança dos dispositivos móveis tornou-se a primeira linha de defesa do cidadão.\nPara Ricardo Coelho, head de Operações de MSS e xMDR para a América Latina, na Cipher, a proteção da privacidade hoje exige um \"estado de vigília\" constante, unindo o rigor técnico à percepção aguçada contra manipulações psicológicas.\nA porta de entrada mais comum para invasões ainda reside no que é obsoleto, ele explica. “Manter sistemas operacionais e aplicativos atualizados não é apenas uma questão de novas funcionalidades, mas de fechar brechas que cibercriminosos exploram rotineiramente.”\nNo entanto, a tecnologia sozinha não basta quando o alvo é o comportamento humano. Isso porque, alerta o especialista, o uso de \"iscas\" digitais — como promessas de prêmios e descontos irresistíveis via redes sociais — continua sendo uma tática altamente eficaz. Atualmente, o perigo se manifesta de formas criativas, como códigos QR falsos e pesquisas online fraudulentas.\n\"Esses golpes costumam explorar o senso de urgência, pressionando a vítima a agir rapidamente e sem tempo para avaliar se a solicitação é legítima\", aponta o texto técnico da Cipher.\nAlém dos smartphones, o ecossistema da Internet das Coisas (IoT) surge como um novo flanco de vulnerabilidade. Câmeras de segurança e termostatos conectados, muitas vezes negligenciados pelos usuários, podem servir como \"cavalos de Troia\" para redes domésticas e corporativas.\nEra do pishing de precisão\nSe antes os e-mails de fraude eram facilmente identificáveis por erros gramaticais e design precário, a Inteligência Artificial Generativa mudou esse jogo. A IA agora ocupa um papel ambíguo: é, simultaneamente, o escudo de defesa e a arma do agressor.\nA automação permitiu que criminosos mimetizassem identidades de forma quase perfeita, elevando o nível de sofisticação de ataques como o vishing (phishing por voz) e o spear phishing (direcionado).\n\"Com o apoio da IA, os ataques se tornaram mais rápidos, profissionais e difíceis de identificar, muitas vezes passando despercebidos por usuários e até por equipes que não contam com ferramentas de defesa avançadas\", destaca a análise.\nEm celebração ao Dia Internacional da Proteção de Dados Pessoais, confira uma série de recomendações para reduzir o risco de exposição de informações privadas em dispositivos móveis:\n- Ativar o cifrado e a gestão remota: Garantir que os equipamentos contem com criptografia de dados e possibilidade de bloqueio ou limpeza remota em caso de perda ou roubo.\n- Utilizar autenticação multifator (MFA): Adicionar uma camada extra de segurança para o acesso a aplicativos bancários, e-mails e plataformas de trabalho.\n- Manter os sistemas atualizados: Instalar sempre as últimas versões de software e patches de segurança no sistema operacional e nos aplicativos.\n- Evitar redes Wi-Fi públicas: Conectar-se apenas a redes seguras ou utilizar uma rede privada virtual (VPN) para criptografar o tráfego.\n- Conscientização contra Phishing de IA: Desconfiar de mensagens excessivamente urgentes ou sites que solicitem dados sensíveis, mesmo que pareçam legítimos.\n- Separar o uso pessoal do profissional: Em modelos de Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), estabelecer políticas claras de segurança para isolar os dados corporativos dos aplicativos pessoais.",

O caso foi distribuído por sorteio ao ministro Flávio Dino, que será o relator da ação.\nA partir de agora, o magistrado pode conceder a liminar de forma monocrática e suspender a medida provisoria até que a ação seja julgada em plenário, ou pode indeferir o pedido de urgência e aguardar a votação colegiada sobre o tema.\nO julgamento no plenário do STF depende da manifestação prévia de todas as partes interessadas e de o presidente do Supremo, ministro Edson Fachin, incluir a pauta no calendário de votação. Não há prazo para isso.\nA medida provisória que instituiu a renovação automática da CNH foi assinada em janeiro pelo ministro dos Transportes, Renan Filho. Com ela, motoristas que não tenham recebido multa nos últimos 12 meses ficam isentos do pagamento de taxas e de realizar exames presenciais para a renovação do documento.\nSegundo o Ministério dos Transportes, o processo de renovação automática é 100% digital pelo sistema da Senatran.\nA \"MP do Bom Condutor”, como foi chamada pelo governo, também vai ajudar a atingir a meta de reduzir em até 80% o custo total da habilitação. Segundo dados do governo, cerca de 370 mil pessoas poderão ter a carteira renovada com o benefício.",

      "content": "Anvisa libera cultivo de maconha para fins medicinais no Brasil e amplia acesso a medicamentos; entenda o que muda\n- Author, Vitor Tavares\n- Role, Da BBC News Brasil em São Paulo\n- Tempo de leitura: 4 min\nA Anvisa (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária) autorizou nesta quarta-feira (28/1) o cultivo de Cannabis sativa no Brasil para fins medicinais e de pesquisa.\nA reunião cumpriu uma decisão do Superior Tribunal de Justiça (STJ) que, em novembro de 2024, definiu a legalidade da produção \"para fins exclusivamente medicinais e/ou farmacêuticos atrelados à proteção do direito à saúde\".\nPara fins medicinais, foi autorizado por unanimidade entre os diretores da Anvisa o cultivo do cânhamo industrial, uma variação da Cannabis sativa com teor de tetrahidrocanabinol (THC) inferior a 0,3% — o THC é o principal componente psicoativo da planta.\nEssa variação não causa efeitos psicotrópicos, ao mesmo tempo em que possui alto teor de canabidiol (CBD), valorizado por seu potencial terapêutico em tratamentos de ansiedade, dor crônica, epilepsia, distúrbios do sono e outras condições neurológicas.\nSegundo a regulação, a produção será limitada, compatível com a demanda farmacêutica, e as empresas devem informar e justificar as quantidades, incluindo os hectares da área a ser utilizada na produção.\nNão foi liberado plantio para a população em geral, apenas empresas e associações, e a medida também não trata do uso recreativo.\nNo caso de variações com THC acima de 0,3%, está autorizado o cultivo destinado exclusivamente a fins de pesquisa e a ambientes regulatórios experimentais autorizados pela Anvisa.\nNesses casos, são exigidos requisitos de segurança e controle com inspeção prévia do local pela autoridade sanitária, exigência de barreiras físicas de proteção, vigilância 24 horas por dia — com sistema de câmeras e alarmes, acesso restrito e controle de entrada e saída.\nSegundo Anvisa, para tomar a decisão, foram realizadas 29 consultas com associações de pacientes e com a comunidade científica que estuda os usos medicinais da maconha, além de buscar experiências internacionais.\nTambém participaram das discussões o Ministério da Saúde, o Ministério da Agricultura e Pecuária (Mapa), o Ministério da Justiça e a Embrapa.\nAutorização especial\nAgora você pode receber as notícias da BBC News Brasil no seu celular.\nClique para se inscrever\nFim do Whatsapp!\nPara qualquer modalidade de cultivo, o estabelecimento deve obter uma autorização especial emitida pela Anvisa com coordenadas geográficas georreferenciadas, registro fotográfico da área, estimativa de produção e plano de controle e monitoramento.\nOs estabelecimentos autorizados podem adquirir, cultivar, pesquisar, importar (material de propagação), armazenar e distribuir a planta para fins medicinais.\nÉ obrigatória a análise laboratorial do teor de THC em cada lote da droga vegetal obtida. É vedada a exportação da planta e de suas sementes.\nSegundo a regulação, as atividades serão imediatamente suspensas e a produção destruída em casos de padrão não justificado ou qualquer outra possível irregularidade.\nEstá prevista a criação de um comitê coordenado pela Anvisa, Ministério da Justiça Ministério da Saúde e Ministério da Agricultura e Pecuária para fiscalização e segurança em todas as etapas de produção, com ações permanentes de controle.\nAnvisa também ampliou acesso para o uso de cannabis medicinal\nMais cedo, a agência já tinha aprovado uma resolução que autorizou a venda do fitofármaco canabidiol em farmácias de manipulação, além de expandir as formas de uso das terapias à base da cannabis para remédios usados via bucal, sublingual e dermatológica.\nAntes, só fármacos do tipo oral (para engolir) e inalatório podiam ser registrados pela agência.\nEntre os pontos principais também está a mudança para sobre quem pode usar os medicamentos à base de cannabis com concentração de THC (tetrahidrocanabinol) acima de 0,2%.\nHoje, só pacientes em cuidados paliativos ou com condições clínicas irreversíveis ou terminais podiam usar produtos acima desse índice. Agora, pacientes com doenças debilitantes graves também vão poder usar.\nSobre a publicidade, antes completamente vedada, agora está autorizada para médicos que prescrevem o medicamento e apenas por meio de rotulagem e de folheto informativo previamente aprovados pela Anvisa\nLegalização 'silenciosa'?\nAntes dessa aprovação, o Brasil vivia uma \"legalização silenciosa\" do uso medicinal da cannabis.\nO plantio de cannabis para uso medicinal e científico já era previsto no Brasil desde 2006, por meio da lei 11.343, a chamada Lei de Drogas. Mas pouco se avançou na sua regulamentação nos anos seguintes.\nEm 2014, a Anvisa passou a autorizar a importação de remédios de CBD, mas trazer o produto custava caro, tornando a medicação inviável para famílias mais pobres.\nJá em dezembro de 2019, a entidade regulamentou a pesquisa, produção e venda de remédios no país por parte da indústria farmacêutica, embora as plantas ainda precisem ser trazidas do exterior.\nA falta de regulamentação levou a decisões judiciais autorizando pacientes a cultivar cannabis para tratar diversas patologias, como autismo, epilepsia, Alzheimer, depressão, ansiedade e enxaqueca crônica.",

          "content": "Dia da Proteção de Dados: como proteger informações em dispositivos móveis\nEspecialistas apontam que os dispositivos móveis se tornaram um dos principais focos de risco para as informações pessoais\nNesta quarta-feira, 28, o Dia Internacional da Proteção de Dados Pessoais convida à reflexão sobre como as informações privadas são protegidas em um ambiente cada vez mais digitalizado.\nDiante de um cenário de mudanças, os dispositivos móveis, que armazenam dados bancários, credenciais de trabalho, conversas e conteúdos pessoais, tornaram-se um dos pontos mais críticos para a privacidade.\nComo a evolução da IA exige maior proteção de dados?\nA rápida evolução da inteligência artificial aumentou a sofisticação dos ataques, facilitando o acesso indevido a dados pessoais e expondo tanto usuários quanto organizações a riscos crescentes de vazamentos e fraudes.\nEsse cenário é especialmente desafiador para o Brasil. Somente no primeiro semestre de 2025, o país concentrou 315 bilhões de tentativas de ataques cibernéticos, o que representa 84% do volume total registrado na América Latina, segundo dados apresentados no evento Fortinet Cybersecurity Summit Brasil, em agosto de 2025.\nA exposição de dados pessoais é agravada pelo uso de inteligência artificial generativa na criação de malwares e campanhas de phishing cada vez mais personalizadas, capazes de enganar até mesmo usuários experientes.\nEssas técnicas automatizadas reduzem o tempo de execução dos ataques e ampliam seu alcance, aumentando os riscos para a privacidade, especialmente em organizações que adotam modelos de trabalho remoto.\nCom mais de 70% dos incidentes associados a falhas humanas, a proteção dos dispositivos a partir dos quais se acessam dados pessoais tornou-se um fator-chave para a continuidade dos negócios e o cumprimento da LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados).\n“A tecnologia nos trouxe múltiplas formas de nos conectarmos e acessarmos nossas informações pessoais por meio de dispositivos móveis, mas também ampliou as vulnerabilidades. Proteger esses equipamentos já não é opcional; é uma condição essencial para resguardar os dados pessoais e a privacidade, tanto no âmbito individual quanto corporativo”, afirma Catarina Viegas, CEO da Cipher para a América Latina.\nNesse contexto, a executiva destaca que a inteligência artificial também pode ser uma aliada na proteção de dados. “A mesma tecnologia que hoje potencializa os ataques também fortalece as defesas. Na Cipher, utilizamos analítica avançada e monitoramento contínuo para antecipar comportamentos anômalos antes que se transformem em um vazamento de dados pessoais”, explica Viegas.\nEstado de vigília constante\nEm um mundo onde a fronteira entre o físico e o digital praticamente desapareceu, a segurança dos dispositivos móveis tornou-se a primeira linha de defesa do cidadão.\nPara Ricardo Coelho, head de Operações de MSS e xMDR para a América Latina, na Cipher, a proteção da privacidade hoje exige um \"estado de vigília\" constante, unindo o rigor técnico à percepção aguçada contra manipulações psicológicas.\nA porta de entrada mais comum para invasões ainda reside no que é obsoleto, ele explica. “Manter sistemas operacionais e aplicativos atualizados não é apenas uma questão de novas funcionalidades, mas de fechar brechas que cibercriminosos exploram rotineiramente.”\nNo entanto, a tecnologia sozinha não basta quando o alvo é o comportamento humano. Isso porque, alerta o especialista, o uso de \"iscas\" digitais — como promessas de prêmios e descontos irresistíveis via redes sociais — continua sendo uma tática altamente eficaz. Atualmente, o perigo se manifesta de formas criativas, como códigos QR falsos e pesquisas online fraudulentas.\n\"Esses golpes costumam explorar o senso de urgência, pressionando a vítima a agir rapidamente e sem tempo para avaliar se a solicitação é legítima\", aponta o texto técnico da Cipher.\nAlém dos smartphones, o ecossistema da Internet das Coisas (IoT) surge como um novo flanco de vulnerabilidade. Câmeras de segurança e termostatos conectados, muitas vezes negligenciados pelos usuários, podem servir como \"cavalos de Troia\" para redes domésticas e corporativas.\nEra do pishing de precisão\nSe antes os e-mails de fraude eram facilmente identificáveis por erros gramaticais e design precário, a Inteligência Artificial Generativa mudou esse jogo. A IA agora ocupa um papel ambíguo: é, simultaneamente, o escudo de defesa e a arma do agressor.\nA automação permitiu que criminosos mimetizassem identidades de forma quase perfeita, elevando o nível de sofisticação de ataques como o vishing (phishing por voz) e o spear phishing (direcionado).\n\"Com o apoio da IA, os ataques se tornaram mais rápidos, profissionais e difíceis de identificar, muitas vezes passando despercebidos por usuários e até por equipes que não contam com ferramentas de defesa avançadas\", destaca a análise.\nEm celebração ao Dia Internacional da Proteção de Dados Pessoais, confira uma série de recomendações para reduzir o risco de exposição de informações privadas em dispositivos móveis:\n- Ativar o cifrado e a gestão remota: Garantir que os equipamentos contem com criptografia de dados e possibilidade de bloqueio ou limpeza remota em caso de perda ou roubo.\n- Utilizar autenticação multifator (MFA): Adicionar uma camada extra de segurança para o acesso a aplicativos bancários, e-mails e plataformas de trabalho.\n- Manter os sistemas atualizados: Instalar sempre as últimas versões de software e patches de segurança no sistema operacional e nos aplicativos.\n- Evitar redes Wi-Fi públicas: Conectar-se apenas a redes seguras ou utilizar uma rede privada virtual (VPN) para criptografar o tráfego.\n- Conscientização contra Phishing de IA: Desconfiar de mensagens excessivamente urgentes ou sites que solicitem dados sensíveis, mesmo que pareçam legítimos.\n- Separar o uso pessoal do profissional: Em modelos de Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), estabelecer políticas claras de segurança para isolar os dados corporativos dos aplicativos pessoais.",

          "content": "Associação vai ao STF contra renovação automática da CNH\nAbrapsit afirmou que medida ameaça a vida e a segurança no trânsito e cria brechas para fraudes; ação está sob relatoria de Flávio Dino\nA Abrapsit (Associação Brasileira de Psicologia do Tráfego) entrou com ação no STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) pedindo a derrubada da medida provisória que estabeleceu a renovação automática da CNH (Carteira Nacional de Habilitação).\nSegundo a associação, a medida ameaça a vida e a segurança no trânsito e cria brechas para fraudes, como a transferência indevida de multas para terceiros.\nO grupo também alerta que a renovação da carteira poderia ocorrer mesmo diante de mudanças no estado de saúde do condutor, incluindo declínio cognitivo ou outras condições potencialmente incapacitantes.\nNa ação, a Abrapsit pede a concessão de uma liminar para derrubar a norma de imediato. O caso foi distribuído por sorteio ao ministro Flávio Dino, que será o relator da ação.\nA partir de agora, o magistrado pode conceder a liminar de forma monocrática e suspender a medida provisoria até que a ação seja julgada em plenário, ou pode indeferir o pedido de urgência e aguardar a votação colegiada sobre o tema.\nO julgamento no plenário do STF depende da manifestação prévia de todas as partes interessadas e de o presidente do Supremo, ministro Edson Fachin, incluir a pauta no calendário de votação. Não há prazo para isso.\nA medida provisória que instituiu a renovação automática da CNH foi assinada em janeiro pelo ministro dos Transportes, Renan Filho. Com ela, motoristas que não tenham recebido multa nos últimos 12 meses ficam isentos do pagamento de taxas e de realizar exames presenciais para a renovação do documento.\nSegundo o Ministério dos Transportes, o processo de renovação automática é 100% digital pelo sistema da Senatran.\nA \"MP do Bom Condutor”, como foi chamada pelo governo, também vai ajudar a atingir a meta de reduzir em até 80% o custo total da habilitação. Segundo dados do governo, cerca de 370 mil pessoas poderão ter a carteira renovada com o benefício.",

          "content": "Anvisa libera cultivo de maconha para fins medicinais no Brasil e amplia acesso a medicamentos; entenda o que muda\n- Author, Vitor Tavares\n- Role, Da BBC News Brasil em São Paulo\n- Tempo de leitura: 4 min\nA Anvisa (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária) autorizou nesta quarta-feira (28/1) o cultivo de Cannabis sativa no Brasil para fins medicinais e de pesquisa.\nA reunião cumpriu uma decisão do Superior Tribunal de Justiça (STJ) que, em novembro de 2024, definiu a legalidade da produção \"para fins exclusivamente medicinais e/ou farmacêuticos atrelados à proteção do direito à saúde\".\nPara fins medicinais, foi autorizado por unanimidade entre os diretores da Anvisa o cultivo do cânhamo industrial, uma variação da Cannabis sativa com teor de tetrahidrocanabinol (THC) inferior a 0,3% — o THC é o principal componente psicoativo da planta.\nEssa variação não causa efeitos psicotrópicos, ao mesmo tempo em que possui alto teor de canabidiol (CBD), valorizado por seu potencial terapêutico em tratamentos de ansiedade, dor crônica, epilepsia, distúrbios do sono e outras condições neurológicas.\nSegundo a regulação, a produção será limitada, compatível com a demanda farmacêutica, e as empresas devem informar e justificar as quantidades, incluindo os hectares da área a ser utilizada na produção.\nNão foi liberado plantio para a população em geral, apenas empresas e associações, e a medida também não trata do uso recreativo.\nNo caso de variações com THC acima de 0,3%, está autorizado o cultivo destinado exclusivamente a fins de pesquisa e a ambientes regulatórios experimentais autorizados pela Anvisa.\nNesses casos, são exigidos requisitos de segurança e controle com inspeção prévia do local pela autoridade sanitária, exigência de barreiras físicas de proteção, vigilância 24 horas por dia — com sistema de câmeras e alarmes, acesso restrito e controle de entrada e saída.\nSegundo Anvisa, para tomar a decisão, foram realizadas 29 consultas com associações de pacientes e com a comunidade científica que estuda os usos medicinais da maconha, além de buscar experiências internacionais.\nTambém participaram das discussões o Ministério da Saúde, o Ministério da Agricultura e Pecuária (Mapa), o Ministério da Justiça e a Embrapa.\nAutorização especial\nAgora você pode receber as notícias da BBC News Brasil no seu celular.\nClique para se inscrever\nFim do Whatsapp!\nPara qualquer modalidade de cultivo, o estabelecimento deve obter uma autorização especial emitida pela Anvisa com coordenadas geográficas georreferenciadas, registro fotográfico da área, estimativa de produção e plano de controle e monitoramento.\nOs estabelecimentos autorizados podem adquirir, cultivar, pesquisar, importar (material de propagação), armazenar e distribuir a planta para fins medicinais.\nÉ obrigatória a análise laboratorial do teor de THC em cada lote da droga vegetal obtida. É vedada a exportação da planta e de suas sementes.\nSegundo a regulação, as atividades serão imediatamente suspensas e a produção destruída em casos de padrão não justificado ou qualquer outra possível irregularidade.\nEstá prevista a criação de um comitê coordenado pela Anvisa, Ministério da Justiça Ministério da Saúde e Ministério da Agricultura e Pecuária para fiscalização e segurança em todas as etapas de produção, com ações permanentes de controle.\nAnvisa também ampliou acesso para o uso de cannabis medicinal\nMais cedo, a agência já tinha aprovado uma resolução que autorizou a venda do fitofármaco canabidiol em farmácias de manipulação, além de expandir as formas de uso das terapias à base da cannabis para remédios usados via bucal, sublingual e dermatológica.\nAntes, só fármacos do tipo oral (para engolir) e inalatório podiam ser registrados pela agência.\nEntre os pontos principais também está a mudança para sobre quem pode usar os medicamentos à base de cannabis com concentração de THC (tetrahidrocanabinol) acima de 0,2%.\nHoje, só pacientes em cuidados paliativos ou com condições clínicas irreversíveis ou terminais podiam usar produtos acima desse índice. Agora, pacientes com doenças debilitantes graves também vão poder usar.\nSobre a publicidade, antes completamente vedada, agora está autorizada para médicos que prescrevem o medicamento e apenas por meio de rotulagem e de folheto informativo previamente aprovados pela Anvisa\nLegalização 'silenciosa'?\nAntes dessa aprovação, o Brasil vivia uma \"legalização silenciosa\" do uso medicinal da cannabis.\nO plantio de cannabis para uso medicinal e científico já era previsto no Brasil desde 2006, por meio da lei 11.343, a chamada Lei de Drogas. Mas pouco se avançou na sua regulamentação nos anos seguintes.\nEm 2014, a Anvisa passou a autorizar a importação de remédios de CBD, mas trazer o produto custava caro, tornando a medicação inviável para famílias mais pobres.\nJá em dezembro de 2019, a entidade regulamentou a pesquisa, produção e venda de remédios no país por parte da indústria farmacêutica, embora as plantas ainda precisem ser trazidas do exterior.\nA falta de regulamentação levou a decisões judiciais autorizando pacientes a cultivar cannabis para tratar diversas patologias, como autismo, epilepsia, Alzheimer, depressão, ansiedade e enxaqueca crônica.",

          "content": "We live in a golden age of controllers. The gamepads on the market now are of higher quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from even one console generation ago. If you play games on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you have the unenviable task of choosing between several controllers from Microsoft as well as a plethora of great options from the likes of 8BitDo, PowerA, Razer, Scuf, GameSir, and Hyperkin. Some of them have drift-resistant Hall effect or TMR-based joysticks for improved longevity, yet all of them are good for one reason or another. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool but barely worked are over.\nThe best Xbox controller to buy right now\nFrom basic and affordable to premium and ultra-customizable, these are the best controllers we’ve tested for Xbox.\nFrom basic and affordable to premium and ultra-customizable, these are the best controllers we’ve tested for Xbox.\nWe’ve spent time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may not be a surprise that the standard Xbox Wireless Controller is the best option for most folks. It makes for a great PC and Steam Deck controller, too. The default Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, but there are several alternatives worth considering.\nFeatured Products\nWhat we’re looking for\nWe test Xbox controllers by playing with them for an extended period of time across a variety of genres. Our test targets include team-based arena games like Marvel Rivals, competitive shooters like Call of Duty, fighters like Tekken 8, and role-playing titles like Elden Ring. When doing so, we pay close attention to how all of the components feel. Are the triggers satisfying to pull? Do the analog sticks offer the right level of resistance? Are the D-pads and face buttons too mushy, or just right? If a controller includes customization options — such as adjustable trigger stops and sensitivity, and / or remappable back buttons — we test how easy they are to configure, then judge their impact on our gameplay experience.\nIs it wireless? Does it support Bluetooth? Or is it wired only? If so, is the cable replaceable?\nDoes it feel cheap or nicely made? Any glitches or reliability issues while testing?\nDoes it have handy extras, like remappable buttons or customizable triggers?\nCan you remap buttons or tune it with custom software profiles?\nIs it priced affordably, about average, or does it come at a steep premium?\nThe best Xbox controller for most people\nXbox Wireless Controller\nThe Good\n- Incredible value for Xbox Wireless support\n- Great ergonomic design\n- Satisfying buttons and triggers\nThe Bad\n- Lacks customization\n- Requires AA batteries (or an optional rechargeable cell)\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Power: AA batteries or add-on rechargeable\nOkay, I already know what you’re thinking. “The best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?” That may seem like a no-brainer, but this standard controller truly does earn this title as the best. It lacks some extras found on pricier options, but this controller is the distillation of all that has made the last 20 years of Xbox gamepads great, and it shows.\nThanks to Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol, the Xbox Wireless Controller is the only affordable wireless option out there. (Third-party wireless alternatives are available, but they’re mostly at the high end.) While some hate the standard Xbox wireless controller for its use of AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. And user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use. It also works over a USB-C wired connection.\nBut the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its varied connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $65 (and often less) asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you’ll probably be best served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like Hori’s Horipad Pro — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is otherwise an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.\nThe only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity (button remapping is available), though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its Xbox Design Lab, which bumps the price from $79.99 to $124.93 depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors that Microsoft offers.\nThe best cheap Xbox controller\n8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox\nThe Good\n- Inexpensive\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Satisfying buttons and Hall effect components\n- Programmable back buttons are easy to press\nThe Bad\n- Lacks trigger stops\nConnectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Wired\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox is a fantastic budget model that typically retails for $44.99 but can often be found for as little as $29.99. The shape is reminiscent of Nintendo’s Switch Pro Controller, only a bit smaller, with hints of Xbox influence and a curvaceous design that feels great to hold.\nOn the hardware front, the Ultimate Wired Controller features Hall effect sticks with satisfying tension. It also uses Hall effect triggers with dedicated vibration motors, though it lacks trigger stops, unlike our previous budget pick, the PowerA Advantage Wired. Its D-pad, face buttons, and bumpers are nice and clicky, too, despite being smaller than we’d typically like. It has two rear paddles, remappable buttons, and the ability to save up to three profiles, which you can switch between on the fly using a dedicated button. There’s even a built-in mute switch for audio, which isn’t common on cheaper controllers. You can download the 8BitDo Ultimate Software X app on PC or Xbox to fully customize this controller.\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired works as a wired controller with your PC, but if you prefer wireless connectivity, the company also makes a three-mode wireless version for $69.99 with support for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (via a dongle). The wireless version is a bit more expensive, however, and it’s still limited to wired connectivity on Xbox consoles.\nThe best “pro” Xbox controller\nXbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2\nThe Good\n- Extensive modular customization\n- Premium look and feel\n- Rechargeable battery lasts an incredible 40 hours\nThe Bad\n- Pricey\n- Questionable quality control\n- No Hall effect components\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Up to four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nThe Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is Microsoft’s fanciest controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and as a result, it just feels nicer in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $199.99 (or sometimes less, if it’s on sale).\nThere’s also the stripped-down Elite Series 2 “Core” version with an MSRP of $149.99, which ditches the add-ons but is equally customizable. You can buy them separately in a $59.99 accessories pack, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.\nA pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of a splurge purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels that require its high-end features. Nevertheless, it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your liking, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc., while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool or easy as when using an Elite.\nWhile the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of stick drift after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers).\nEven so, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.\nA formidable alternative to the Elite\nRazer Wolverine V3 Pro\nThe Good\n- Supports Xbox Wireless protocol\n- Hall effect sticks use replaceable tops\n- Four rear buttons smartly positioned for comfort\n- Two extra shoulder buttons add unique versatility\n- Trigger stops and back buttons offer a satisfying mouse-like click\nThe Bad\n- Expensive\n- Requires a USB dongle\n- Razer Synapse software needs work\nConnectivity: Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nAt $199.99, Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro controller is as expensive (or more, depending on available deals) than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, yielding a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours).\nOther than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.\nThe Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its more basic software customization, its lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its high price, which, unlike the Series 2, is rarely subjected to discounts. Luckily, if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired configuration.\nAn affordable alternative to the Elite\nGameSir’s G7 Pro is a wired Xbox controller with remapable rear buttons, adjustable triggers, and TMR joysticks. It can also be connected wirelessly to a PC (via a 2.4Ghz dongle) or Android (via Bluetooth).\nConnectivity: Wired (Xbox), wireless USB dongle (PC), Bluetooth (Android) / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nIf you don’t mind using a wired controller, GameSir’s G7 Pro offers some features of the splurge-worthy Xbox Elite Controller 2 for under $100. It has remappable buttons, smooth-feeling drift-resistant TMR control sticks, a satisfying weight, and textured grips that made it feel comfortable to hold even with sweaty palms.\nThe G7 Pro is actually a battery-powered wireless controller, but its cable free connectivity is limited to PC (via an included 2.4Ghz dongle) and Android (via Bluetooth). You’ll need to plug the controller into the Xbox with a cable, and GameSir provides a lengthy USB-C to USB-A cord. The cable was long enough that I could play games from my couch (roughly six feet away) without feeling tethered.\nI was impressed with the G7 Pro’s overall build quality, especially the triggers, which could be locked by flipping switches on its back. GameSir includes three swappable direction pads with the G7 Pro, which can be swapped by lifting the front of the controller’s shell and popping them in and out. However, its face buttons felt noticeably cheaper than the ones on the Elite 2, which makes sense given their price difference. Button feel aside, the controller never dropped an input, even when I mashed buttons to string together elaborate combos in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, or continuously cast spells, dodged, and healed in Diablo IV. If an action was mistimed, it was on me.\nWhat the controller lacks in face button quality is more than made up for in customizability. GameSir Nexus, a free app on the Xbox Store, allowed me to remap any button (including the L4 and R4 buttons on its backside), adjust the vibration intensity of both triggers, enable two flavors of hair trigger mode, and set the deadzone for each control stick. You can save up to four profiles with different settings, and quickly switch between them by pressing the controller’s M button along with one of the face buttons. You never need to touch these options, or even download the GameSir Nexus app for the G7 Pro to work, but doing so will unlock its full potential.\nThe GameSir G7 Pro is an excellent Xbox controller, especially in its price range. I’d have liked the option to use it wirelessly, but that wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. That said, it’s something to consider depending on how far away you are from your Xbox when playing. If you’re a multi-platform gamer and want a controller to use with both an Xbox and PC (or Android device), it’s an even better choice.\nThe best Xbox controller for multi-console gamers\nHyperkin’s Competitor is a wired Xbox controller that looks and feels like Sony’s PlayStation 5 DualSense gamepad. It has symmetrical Hall effect joysticks, four-button directional pad, and a pair of programmable back buttons.\nConnectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: No / Power: N/A\nHyperkin’s cheekily-named Competitor wired Xbox and PC-compatible controller that looks and feels like the DualSense gamepad that comes with the PlayStation 5 — aka one of the Xbox’s main competitors. The controller’s Hall effect joysticks are symmetrical and located at the bottom, while a four-button directional pad sits above the left grip. The giant “X” button in the middle of the controller is an immediate giveaway that you’re using an Xbox gamepad, but it was easy to forget I wasn’t using a DualSense when playing games.\nIn terms of comfort the Competitor was on par with Microsoft’s official Xbox Wireless Controller. I’ve played enough PlayStation games over the years that using the gamepad felt intuitive, with no need to adjust my muscle memory, or change my grip. Playing with a wired controller can feel restrictive, but the long USB-C to USB-A cable included with the Competitor prevented me from feeling tethered. The cable is replaceable, which is good news if yours gets frayed or otherwise damaged over time.\nOverall, I was pleased with the controller’s construction. It was heavy enough to feel substantial, but light enough that I never felt wrist fatigue after holding it for an hour or more. Its buttons were all satisfyingly clickey, and its joysticks glided smoothly. The controller has two programmable back buttons, which you can program by pressing one of the rear buttons and the “M” button that’s also located on the controller’s backside. The controller rumbles to let you know it’s time to press another button on the controller to set the hot key. Each back button has to be programmed one at a time, and can be disabled by flipping a switch.\nMy tests included playing Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, Crash Bandicoot 4, Trials of Mana, and Tales of Arise. I had no problems jumping (or skating as it were) into any of these games. Playing them felt intuitive, and the controller never dropped an input. A benefit to playing games with a wired controller is there’s less latency between when you press a button and an action happens on screen. The difference is generally imperceptible (unless you play online games competitively), but there were probably a couple of Tony Hawk combos I nailed in the nick of time thanks to the lower latency.\nMy personal preference will always be to play Xbox games with a wireless controller because it’s the least restrictive type of gamepad. However, Hyperkin’s Competitor is a great gamepad in general, and an especially good choice if you’re regularly switching between playing Xbox, PC, and PS5 games. It doesn’t offer the same amount of customization as the GameSir G7 or Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, but its design and $49.99 MSRP more than make up for those shortcomings.\nOther Xbox controllers to consider\n- The Scuf Valor Pro is the company’s first Xbox controller with Hall effect sticks, as well as its cheapest at $109.99. Scuf emulates Microsoft’s winning ergonomics while implementing redesigned remappable rear buttons (two are removable) and shoulder bumpers that are more comfortable to reach. It also has trigger stops that produce a satisfying click with next to no travel when pressed. The D-pad produces a similarly satisfying click, one we prefer over the softer tactile feel of the Instinct. The Valor Pro is not the most exciting controller on paper, but it’s a solid option for Scuf faithful or anyone who wants more durable analog sticks. Read our hands-on impressions.\n- We tested PowerA’s latest pro-style Xbox controllers, including the Fusion Pro 4 Wired ($79.99) and PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless ($169.99). They’re standard fare for pro-style controllers these days, with height-adjustable Hall effect sticks, four remappable rear buttons, three-way trigger locks, and onboard volume controls. They’re similar, but the Pro Wireless has four trippy Lumectra lighting zones that respond to your button presses. Both controllers are satisfying to use and a clear step up from PowerA’s older products in terms of overall quality, but they ultimately don’t stand out much at these price points.\nWhat’s coming next\n- At CES 2026, 8BitDo unveiled its second officially licensed wireless Xbox controller, the $149.99 Ultimate 3E. It isn’t coming until Q2, but there are reasons to get excited, especially if you like to customize your gamepads. The new model features swappable ABXY buttons, and you can also swap out the joysticks and D-pad for others included with each purchase. It offers TMR joysticks, Hall effect triggers, and a pair of rear bumpers. It connects to Xbox via the included 2.4GHz USB dongle, though it also supports Bluetooth for connecting to Apple and Android devices.\nUpdate, January 28th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and add a mention of 8BitDo’s forthcoming Ultimate 3E controller.

Google later added the ability for Gemini to compare products across multiple tabs and recall pages from your browsing history, while hinting at allowing the AI agent to perform “tedious tasks.”\nGoogle says that while using auto browse, Gemini can identify decorations inside of a photo you’re looking at, find similar items on the web, add them to your cart, apply discount codes, all while staying within your budget. If a task requires you to log into an account, Gemini can also use the browser’s password manager to log in.\nAlong with this change, Google has moved Gemini in Chrome from a pop-up window to a panel anchored to the right side of your screen. It now supports integrations with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, Google Shopping, and Google Flights for all users, allowing it to reference information from across the apps you use, as well as perform actions within them.\n“For example, if you’re traveling to a conference and need to book a flight, Gemini can dig up that old email with event details, reference context from Google Flights to provide some recommendations, and later draft an email letting your colleagues know your arrival time,” Google writes.\nYou’ll also find Nano Banana — Google’s AI-powered image generator — in the new Gemini in Chrome panel. This feature is coming to all Gemini in Chrome users, and lets you edit an image inside your window using a text prompt.\nGoogle has more in store down the road for Gemini in Chrome as it competes with other agentic AI browsers, including OpenAI’s Atlas and Perplexity’s Comet. Personal intelligence, an opt-in feature that first launched inside the Gemini app, gives Gemini the ability to reference your past conversations, as well as use its reasoning capabilities to analyze the data linked to your Gmail, Calendar, Photos, and search history. Google says it plans on bringing the feature to Chrome in the “coming months.”",

          "content": "Microsoft just posted the second quarter of its 2026 fiscal financial results. The software maker made $81.3 billion in revenue and a net income of $30.9 billion during Q3. Revenue is up 17 percent, and net income has increased by 23 percent.\nMicrosoft reports strong cloud earnings in Q2 as gaming declines\nMicrosoft’s More Personal Computing division was the only business unit to post a revenue decline this quarter.\nMicrosoft’s More Personal Computing division was the only business unit to post a revenue decline this quarter.\nThe holiday quarter saw PC shipments grow unexpectedly amid an ongoing RAM shortage. Microsoft’s end of Windows 10 support helped push PC shipments up, but IDC revealed earlier this month that PC makers have also been aggressively pulling forward inventory to combat potential tariffs and ongoing global memory shortage.\nMicrosoft’s Windows OEM and devices revenue over this holiday period was up just 1 percent year-over-year. Businesses and consumers have clearly been upgrading PCs and laptops during the Windows 10 end of life period, because Windows OEM revenue on its own was up 5 percent. But this revenue was offset by a decline in devices revenue as Microsoft combines Surface revenue and Windows OEM revenue together now.\nMicrosoft didn’t announce any new Surface devices during the recent quarter, after launching both the 12-inch Surface Pro and 13-inch Surface Laptop in May last year. I would expect to hear more about new Surface devices in the spring.\nMicrosoft’s Xbox hardware revenue has declined for three financial years in a row, and it looks like those declining revenues are going to continue throughout fiscal 2026. Xbox hardware revenue was down 32 percent year-over-year during the recent holiday quarter. Overall gaming revenue was also down 9 percent.\nXbox content and services, which includes Game Pass, is down 5 percent, too. This decline is largely being attributed to stronger first-party content performance in the previous year, and not the Game Pass Ultimate price hike during the quarter. That points towards softer sales numbers for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which not only had to go up against Battlefield 6, but also the success of Black Ops 6 last year.\nUnsurprisingly, Microsoft isn’t giving us an update on Xbox Game Pass subscriber numbers. The company last reported it had 34 million subscribers nearly two years ago, which included Xbox Game Pass Essential (previously Xbox Live Gold / Game Pass Core) members.\nMicrosoft has continued to publish more games on PS5, as part of its strategy to make previously Xbox-exclusive games available on Nintendo and Sony platforms. Microsoft revealed last year that Halo: Campaign Evolved is coming to PS5 and Xbox in 2026, and Fable and Forza Horizon 6 are also coming to Sony’s console this year.\nMicrosoft’s cloud revenue was once again strong this quarter, and even crossed $50 billion overall — up 26 percent year-over-year. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 39 percent.“ Microsoft Cloud revenue crossed $50 billion this quarter, reflecting the strong demand for our portfolio of services,” says Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. “We exceeded expectations across revenue, operating income, and earnings per share.”\nAll eyes are still on Microsoft’s AI revenues and the associated costs, and the software maker hasn’t pulled out any specific AI product numbers this quarter. Capital expenditure in Q2 was $37.5 billion, and the majority of that spend was on assets like CPU and GPUs to fuel cloud and AI data centers. Commercial bookings have also increased 230 percent year-over-year, thanks to Azure commitments from OpenAI and Anthropic.\nMicrosoft announced its latest in-house AI chip this week, which will help host GPT-5.2 and other models for Microsoft Foundry and Microsoft 365 Copilot. The Maia 200 chip is designed for large-scale AI workloads and will go head-to-head with similar AI inference chips from Amazon and Google.\nMicrosoft also saw Microsoft 365 consumer cloud revenue growth of 29 percent year-over-year, alongside Microsoft 365 commercial cloud revenue growth of 17 percent. LinkedIn revenue also grew by 11 percent year-over-year.\nThe strength of Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business, which includes Azure and server products, really shines a bright light on the decline of the More Personal Computing business of Windows, Xbox, and Surface. Intelligent Cloud contributed $32.9 billion in revenue this quarter, more than double the $14.3 billion from More Personal Computing. In fact, the More Personal Computing division declined by 3 percent in revenue year-over-year, the only business unit to do so this quarter.\nMicrosoft blames that More Personal Computing decline on gaming, and it was offset by search and news advertising revenues growing by 10 percent and Windows OEM growth.\nMicrosoft will now hold an earnings call at 5:30PM ET, and we’ll update this article with any relevant comments from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood.",

          "content": "Tesla just reported its second consecutive year of declining revenue and profits, further complicating Elon Musk’s $1 trillion effort to transform his company into a leader in AI and robotics. Meanwhile, the global EV market continues to grow, seemingly in spite of the pioneering company’s setbacks.\nTesla hits a grim milestone: its second straight year of decline\nThe automaker has lost the lead to its Chinese competitors as its business continues to contract.\nThe automaker has lost the lead to its Chinese competitors as its business continues to contract.\nTesla said it earned $840 million in net income on $24.9 billion in revenue in the quarter that ended in December 2025. That’s a 3 percent decrease in revenue and a staggering 61 percent decrease in profits over the fourth quarter of 2024, when the company earned $2.3 billion in net income on $25.7 billion in revenue.\nTesla beat expectations from Wall Street, which had predicted that Tesla would report $24.79 billion in revenue according to an average of analyst estimates compiled by LSEG. For the full year 2025, Tesla said it earned $3.8 billion in net income on $94.8 billion in revenue, a 3 percent decrease compared to 2024.\nTesla beat expectations from Wall Street\nThe earnings report comes a few weeks after Tesla lost its title as the world’s best-selling EV company to China’s BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year. The company reported selling about 1.6 million vehicles in 2025, a 8.5 percent decrease year over year. In the fourth quarter alone, it recorded a 15.6 percent drop in customer deliveries, as many people made their purchases in the third quarter to take advantage of expiring federal tax credits.\nMeanwhile, global EV sales continued to grow by leaps and bounds, up 20 percent in 2025. But that growth is expected to cool in 2026 based on weakness in the Chinese market and the pullback of subsidies. Policy shifts, like the Trump administration’s U-turn on EV subsidies and the relaxation of emissions targets, are expected to lead to slower growth in EV sales this year.\nThe drop in revenue was widely expected, given the disastrous year that Tesla just experienced. Tesla’s aging lineup, as well as rising competition from legacy automakers in the US, Europe, and China, put a serious dent in Tesla’s demand. And Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s emergence as a divisive political figure, pushing racist right-wing conspiracies on his social media platform X, throwing Nazi salutes at Donald Trump’s inauguration, and heading the controversial DOGE project in the Trump administration to slash global humanitarian aid programs, has alienated many of the company’s traditionally liberal customers. Musk’s political activity is estimated to have cost Tesla sales of more than 1 million vehicles.\nMusk himself has said that the company is in for “a few rough quarters” thanks to the expiring incentives and other macroeconomic factors. But he believes that Tesla will eventually rebound as its AI plans come to fruition, including robotaxis and humanoid robots. Musk predicted that 50 percent of the US population will have access to Tesla’s robotaxis by the end of 2025 — a prediction that unsurprisingly turned out to be wildly overblown. So far, only a handful of vehicles are available in Austin and San Francisco to a limited number of customers and under strict circumstances.\nThe earnings report also comes on the heels of Musk winning approval from Tesla shareholders for a massive new pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire. Musk would need to meet a series of ambitious milestones to receive the compensation, including producing over a million robots, a million robotaxis, and creating $7.5 trillion in value for Tesla’s shareholders.\nDeveloping…",

          "content": "SpaceX has made a new set of demands on state governments that would ensure Starlink receives federal grant money even when residents don’t purchase Starlink broadband service.\nSpaceX said it will provide “all necessary equipment” to receive broadband “at no cost to subscribers requesting service,” which will apparently eliminate the up-front hardware fee for Starlink equipment. But SpaceX isn’t promising lower-than-usual monthly prices to consumers in those subsidized areas. SpaceX pledged to make broadband available for $80 or less a month, plus taxes and fees, to people with low incomes in the subsidized areas. For comparison, the normal Starlink residential prices advertised on its website range from $50 to $120 a month.\nSpaceX’s demands would also guarantee that it gets paid by the government even if it doesn’t reserve “large portions” of Starlink network capacity for homes in the areas that are supposed to receive government-subsidized Internet service. Moreover, SpaceX would not be responsible for ensuring that Starlink equipment is installed correctly at each customer location.\nSpaceX sent a letter to state broadband offices proposing a rider with terms that it hopes will be applied to all grants it receives throughout the country. The letter was obtained and published by Broadband.io and the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society.\nArguing that SpaceX should receive grant money regardless of whether residents purchase Starlink service, the letter to states said that grant payments should not depend on “the independent purchasing decisions of users.” SpaceX also said it will not hold “large portions of capacity fallow” to ensure that people in subsidized areas receive good service, but will instead continue its preexisting practice of “dynamically allocat[ing] capacity where needed.”\nSpaceX capitalizes on Trump overhaul\nSpaceX’s proposed contract rider would apply to grants distributed under the US government’s Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. BEAD was created by Congress in a 2021 law that authorized spending over $42 billion to make broadband networks available in areas without modern service.",

          "content": "A federal judge in Virginia ruled Tuesday that the City of Norfolk’s use of nearly 200 automated license plate readers (ALPRs) from Flock is constitutional and can continue, dismissing the entire case just days before a bench trial was set to begin.\nThe case, Schmidt v. City of Norfolk, was originally filed in October 2024 by two Virginians who claimed that their rights were violated when the Flock network of cameras captured their cars hundreds of times, calling the entire setup a “dragnet surveillance program.”\nHowever, in a 51-page ruling, US District Court Judge Mark S. Davis disagreed, finding that the “…plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that Defendants’ ALPR system is capable of tracking the whole of a person’s movements.”\nJudge Davis acknowledged that while there may come a time when the use of ALPRs becomes too intrusive, “what is readily apparent to this Court is that, at least in Norfolk, Virginia, the answer is: not today.”\nThe Virginia plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the Institute of Justice, a libertarian nonprofit public interest law firm that vowed to appeal the ruling.\nOver the past decade, Flock Safety has grown to become the most sophisticated and largest ALPR vendor in America. The City of Norfolk—along with thousands of other law enforcement agencies across the country—contracts with the Atlanta-based startup, most recently valued at $7.5 billion, for ALPR services.\nFlock cameras capture not just a simple license plate number—as the tech once did a decade ago—but now can easily capture make, model, and other visual details from each car; these can be searched using AI-powered natural language queries that can include phrases like “bike rack” or “tow truck.”\nRecently, some jurisdictions, from Santa Cruz, California, to Charlottesville, Virginia, have ended their contracts with Flock over concerns that the technology is too invasive and may provide information to federal immigration authorities over the objections of local policymakers. Last year, two senators expressed grave privacy concerns and wrote in a letter to the company that “abuse of Flock cameras is inevitable.”",

Instead, DHS staffers use approved AI-powered tools, like the agency’s DHSChat, which “are configured to prevent queries or documents input into them from leaving federal networks,” Politico reported.\nIt remains unclear why Gottumukkala needed to use ChatGPT. One official told Politico that, to staffers, it seemed like Gottumukkala “forced CISA’s hand into making them give him ChatGPT, and then he abused it.”\nThe information Gottumukkala reportedly leaked was not confidential but marked “for official use only.” That designation, a DHS document explained, is “used within DHS to identify unclassified information of a sensitive nature” that, if shared without authorization, “could adversely impact a person’s privacy or welfare” or impede how federal and other programs “essential to the national interest” operate.\nThere’s now a concern that the sensitive information could be used to answer prompts from any of ChatGPT’s 700 million active users.\nOpenAI did not respond to Ars’ request to comment, but Cyber News reported that experts have warned “that using public AI tools poses real risks because uploaded data can be retained, breached, or used to inform responses to other users.”\nSources told Politico that DHS investigated the incident for potentially harming government security—which could result in administrative or disciplinary actions, DHS officials told Politico. Possible consequences could range from a formal warning or mandatory retraining to “suspension or revocation of a security clearance,” officials said.",

          "content": "On January 12, EA shut down the official servers for Anthem, making Bioware’s multiplayer sci-fi adventure completely unplayable for the first time since its troubled 2019 launch. Last week, though, the Anthem community woke up to a new video showing the game at least partially loading on what appears to be a simulated background server.\nThe people behind that video—and the Anthem revival project that made it possible—told Ars they were optimistic about their efforts to coerce EA’s temperamental Frostbite engine into running the game without access to EA’s servers. That said, the team also wants to temper expectations that may have risen a bit too high in the wake of what is just a proof-of-concept video.\n“People are getting excited [about the video], and naturally people are going to get their hopes up,” project administrator Laurie told Ars. “I don’t want to be the person that’s going to have to deal with the aftermath if it turns out that we can’t actually get anywhere.”\nKeep an eye on those packets\nThe Anthem revival effort currently centers around The Fort’s Forge, a Discord server where a handful of volunteer engineers and developers have gathered to pick apart the game and its unique architecture. Laurie said they initially set up the group “out of little more than spite for EA and Bioware around the time the shutdown got announced” back in July.\nWhile Laurie has some experience with the community behind Gundam Evolution revival project Side 7, they knew they’d need help from people with direct experience working on EA’s Frostbite engine games. Luckily, Laurie said they were “able to catch the eyes of people who are familiar with this line of work [without] searching too much.”\nOne of those people was Ness199X, an experienced Frostbite tinkerer who told Ars he “never really played much Anthem” before the game’s shutdown was announced. When a friend pointed out the impending death of the title, though, Ness said he was motivated to preserve the game for posterity.",

The small tags, however, were collected before the ill-fated launch of Challenger, as was instructed in bold “Remove Before Flight” lettering on the front of each.\nWhat happened to the tags after that is largely unknown.\nThis is an attempt to learn more about where those “Remove Before Flight” tags went after they were detached from the space shuttle and before they arrived on my doorstep. If their history can be better documented, they can be provided to museums, educational centers, and astronautical archives for their preservation and display.\nTo begin, we go back 16 years to when they were offered for sale on eBay.\nFrom handout to hold on\nThe advertisement on the auction website was titled “Space Shuttle Remove Before Flight Flags Lot of 18.” They were listed with an opening bid of $3.99. On January 12, 2010, I paid $5.50 as the winner.\nAt that point, my interest in the 3-inch-wide by 12-inch-long (7.6 by 30.5 cm) tags was as handouts for kids and other attendees at future events. Whether it was at an astronaut autograph convention, a space memorabilia show, a classroom visit, or a conference talk, having “swag” was a great way to foster interest in space history. At first glance, these flags seemed to be a perfect fit.\nSo I didn’t pay much attention when they first arrived. The eBay listing had promoted them only as generic examples of “KSC Form 4-226 (6/77)\"—the ID the Kennedy Space Center assigned to the tags. There was no mention of their being used, let alone specifying an orbiter or specific flight. If I recall correctly, the seller said his intention had been to use them on his boat.",

          "content": "NASA’s Artemis II mission will transport four astronauts around the Moon, bringing the agency one step closer to sending the first astronauts to Mars. Throughout Artemis II, astronaut voice, images, video, and vital mission data must traverse thousands of miles, carried on signals from NASA’s communications systems.\nThrough Artemis, NASA is establishing an enduring presence in space and exploring more of the Moon than ever before. To achieve this, Artemis missions rely on both the Near Space Network and the Deep Space Network. These networks, with oversight by NASA’s SCaN (Space Communications and Navigation) Program office, use global infrastructure and relay satellites to ensure seamless communications and tracking as Orion launches, orbits Earth, travels to the Moon, and returns home.\n“Robust space communications aren’t optional; they’re the essential link that unites the crew and the exploration team on Earth to ensure safety and mission success, as I learned firsthand living and working aboard the International Space Station,” said Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Operations Mission Directorate at the agency’s headquarters in Washington. “From real-time conversations with mission controllers, to the data that drives critical decisions and research, and even calls home — space communications keep astronauts connected to mission managers, technical experts, loved ones, and everyone on Earth who wants to share in the excitement of our exploration missions. As we push farther into deep space, reliable communications links will enable more challenging missions and maximize the benefit for all of us on Earth.”\n\"From real-time conversations with mission controllers, to the data that drives critical decisions, research, and even calls home, space communications keep astronauts connected.\"\nKen Bowersox\nAssociate Administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate\nSpecialists will operate its networks in tandem to enable data exchange between spacecraft and mission controllers on Earth. NASA’s Mission Control Center at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston will track the Space Launch System rocket, Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, and Orion spacecraft through coordinated handoffs between the networks’ multiple assets on Earth and in space for the duration of the mission.\nUsing ground stations around the globe and a fleet of relay satellites, the Near Space Network will provide communications and navigation services during multiple stages of the Artemis II mission operations. The network, managed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, has a long legacy of supporting human spaceflight missions near Earth.\nAfter Orion’s translunar injection burn, which will set the spacecraft on its planned orbit around the Moon, primary communications support will transition to the Deep Space Network, managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. The network’s international array of giant radio antennas, located in California, Spain, and Australia, provides a near-continuous connection to Orion and its crew.\n“Reliable communications are the lifeline of human spaceflight,” said Kevin Coggins, deputy associate administrator for the SCaN Program at NASA Headquarters. “Our networks help make missions like Artemis II possible and set the stage for even more ambitious space exploration in the years ahead. These achievements are driven not only by NASA’s infrastructure but also by strong collaboration with our commercial partners, who play a critical role in advancing the capabilities and resilience of space communications.”\nIn addition to traditional radio network support, the spacecraft will host the Orion Artemis II Optical Communications System, a laser communications terminal that will transmit real science and crew data over laser links. Demonstrations like the recent Deep Space Optical Communications payload have proven laser communications systems can send more than 100 times more data than comparable radio networks, even millions of miles away from Earth. While laser communications will not be on Artemis III, the Orion Artemis II Optical Communications System could pave the way for future laser communications systems at the Moon and Mars.\nThe Orion Artemis II Optical Communications System payload is only one piece of NASA’s larger mission to improve lunar and deep space communications. Orion will experience a planned communications blackout lasting approximately 41 minutes. The blackout will occur as the spacecraft passes behind the Moon, blocking radio frequency signals to and from Earth. Similar blackouts occurred during the Apollo-era missions and are expected when using an Earth-based network infrastructure. When Orion reemerges from behind the Moon, the Deep Space Network will quickly reacquire Orion’s signal and restore communications with mission control. These planned blackouts remain an aspect of all missions operating on or around the Moon’s far side.\nEach Artemis mission will build upon existing capabilities, including data processing and handling. For the Artemis II flight test, data from Orion will be compressed after it reaches Earth to manage the large amount of information. Data compression will reduce image and video quality and give priority to crew communications and mission data.\nLooking ahead, NASA’s Lunar Communications Relay and Navigation Systems project is collaborating with industry to eliminate blackouts and support precise navigation by placing relay satellites around the Moon. This network of orbiting satellites will deliver persistent, high-bandwidth communications and navigation services for astronauts, landers, and orbiters on and around the lunar surface. In 2024, NASA selected Intuitive Machines to develop the first set of lunar relays for demonstration during the Artemis III lunar surface mission.\nFrom liftoff to splashdown, NASA’s evolving networks will serve as the crew’s link home, ensuring that humanity’s return to the Moon stays connected every step of the way.",

          "content": "A new discovery captures the cosmic moment when a galaxy cluster – among the largest structures in the universe – started to assemble only about a billion years after the big bang, one or two billion years earlier than previously thought. This result, made using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and James Webb Space Telescope, will lead astronomers to rethink when and how the largest structures in the universe formed. The findings are described in a paper published [Wednesday] in the journal Nature.\nThe object, known as JADES-ID1 for its location in the “JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey” (JADES) has a mass about 20 trillion times that of the Sun. Astronomers classify JADES-ID1 as a “protocluster” because it is currently undergoing an early, violent phase of formation and will one day turn into a galaxy cluster. However, JADES-ID1 is found at a much larger distance – corresponding to a much earlier time in the universe – than astronomers expected for such systems, providing a new mystery of how it could form so quickly.\n“This may be the most distant confirmed protocluster ever seen,” said Akos Bogdan of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA) who led the study. “JADES-ID1 is giving us new evidence that the universe was in a huge hurry to grow up.”\nGalaxy clusters contain hundreds or even thousands of individual galaxies immersed in enormous pools of superheated gas, along with large amounts of unseen dark matter. Astronomers use galaxy clusters to measure the expansion of the universe and the roles of dark energy and dark matter, among other important cosmic studies.\n“It’s very important to actually see when and how galaxy clusters grow,” said co-author Gerrit Schellenberger, also of CfA. “It’s like watching an assembly line make a car, rather than just trying to figure out how a car works by looking at the finished product.”\nThe Chandra and Webb data reveal that JADES-ID1 contains the two properties that confirm the presence of a protocluster: a large number of galaxies held together by gravity (Webb sees at least 66 potential members) that are also sitting in a huge cloud of hot gas (detected by Chandra). As a galaxy cluster forms, gas falls inward and is heated by shock waves, reaching temperatures of millions of degrees and glowing in X-rays.\nWhat makes JADES-ID1 exceptional is the remarkably early time when it appears in cosmic history. Most models of the universe predict that there likely would not be enough time and a large enough density of galaxies for a protocluster of this size to form only a billion years after the big bang. The previous record holder for a protocluster with X-ray emission is seen much later, about three billion years after the big bang.\n“We thought we’d find a protocluster like this two or three billion years after the big bang – not just one billion,” said co-author Qiong Li from the University of Manchester in the UK. “Before, astronomers found surprisingly large galaxies and black holes not long after the big bang, and now we’re finding that clusters of galaxies can also grow rapidly.”\nAfter billions of years JADES-ID1 should evolve from a protocluster into a massive galaxy cluster like those we see much closer to Earth.\nTo find JADES-ID1, astronomers combined deep observations from both Chandra and Webb. By design, the JADES field overlaps with the Chandra Deep Field South, the site of the deepest X-ray observation ever conducted. This field is thus one of the few in the entire sky where a discovery such as this could be made. In an earlier study, a team of researchers led by Li and Conselice found five other proto-cluster candidates in the JADES field, but only in JADES-ID1 are the galaxies embedded in hot gas. Only JADES-ID1 possesses enough mass for an X-ray signal from hot gas to be expected.\n“Discoveries like this are made when two powerful telescopes like Chandra and Webb stare at the same patch of sky at the limit of their observing capabilities,” said co-author Christopher Conselice, also from the University of Manchester. “A challenge for us now is to understand how this protocluster was able to form so quickly.”\nNASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, manages the Chandra program.

The image is presented twice, once with, and once without, annotations.\nThe image includes scores of glowing dots and specks of light, in white and golden hues, set against the blackness of space. This layer of the composite visual is from a deep infrared imaging project undertaken by the James Webb Space Telescope. The specks range from relatively large oval galaxies with discernible spiral arms, and glowing balls with gleaming diffraction spikes, to minuscule pinpoints of distant light. Several of those pinpoints have been circled in the annotated image, as they are part of the distant protocluster.\nLayered onto the center of this image is a neon blue cloud. This cloud represents hot X-ray gas discovered by Chandra in the deepest X-ray observation ever conducted. In the annotated image, a thin white square surrounds the blue cloud. This represents Chandra’s field of observation. The X-rays from the distant protocluster located within this box are included in the composite image.\nThe protocluster, dubbed JADES-1, has a mass of about 20 trillion suns. It is located some 12.7 billion light-years from Earth, or just a billion years after the big bang. The discovery of a protocluster of this size, at this epoch in the early universe, will lead scientists to re-examine their ideas for how galaxy clusters first appeared in the universe.\nNews Media Contact\nMegan Watzke\nChandra X-ray Center\nCambridge, Mass.\n617-496-7998\nmwatzke@cfa.harvard.edu\nJoel Wallace\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama\n256-544-0034\njoel.w.wallace@nasa.gov",

          "content": "Low-Earth orbit is just 2.8 days from disaster\n- Date:\n- January 28, 2026\n- Source:\n- Universe Today\n- Summary:\n- Low-Earth orbit is more crowdedâand fragileâthan it looks. Satellites constantly weave past each other, burning fuel and making dozens of evasive maneuvers every year just to stay safe. A major solar storm could disable navigation and communications, turning that careful dance into chaos. According to new calculations, it may take just daysânot decadesâfor a catastrophic chain reaction to begin, potentially choking off humanityâs access to space for generations.\n- Share:\nThe phrase \"House of Cards\" is often linked today with a popular Netflix political series, but its original meaning describes something far more literal: a structure that can collapse easily. That idea is exactly how Sarah Thiele, formerly a PhD student at the University of British Columbia and now a researcher at Princeton, and her colleagues characterize today's massive satellite networks. In a new paper available as a pre print on arXiv, they argue that modern satellite mega constellations rest on an unstable foundation.\nTheir reasoning is backed by striking numbers. Across all Low Earth Orbit mega constellations, satellites pass dangerously close to one another with surprising frequency. A \"close approach,\" defined as two satellites coming within less than 1km of each other, happens about once every 22 seconds. Within the Starlink network alone, this occurs roughly every 11 minutes. To avoid collisions, each Starlink satellite must carry out an average of 41 course corrections every year.\nWhen Rare Events Become Serious Risks\nAt first glance, this constant maneuvering might sound like proof that the system is working as intended. Engineers, however, know that failures often come from unusual situations rather than everyday operations. These rare scenarios, often called \"edge cases,\" can expose weaknesses that routine conditions never reveal. According to the study, solar storms are one such scenario that poses a serious threat to satellite mega constellations.\nSolar storms typically disrupt satellites in two main ways.\nHow Solar Storms Disrupt Satellites\nThe first effect is atmospheric heating. When a solar storm hits Earth, it causes the upper atmosphere to expand and thicken, increasing drag on satellites. This added resistance forces satellites to burn more fuel just to stay in orbit and raises uncertainty about their precise positions. As a result, satellites must perform additional avoidance maneuvers to prevent collisions. During the \"Gannon Storm\" of May 2024 (which, unfortunately, appears not to be named after the Zelda villain), more than half of all satellites in LEO were forced to expend fuel on these adjustments.\nThe second effect can be even more damaging. Solar storms can interfere with or disable satellite navigation and communication systems altogether. When that happens, satellites may be unable to respond to threats in their path. Combined with higher atmospheric drag and increased uncertainty, this loss of control could quickly lead to a serious accident.\nMeasuring the Speed of Disaster\nThe most widely known outcome of widespread satellite collisions is Kessler syndrome. In this scenario, debris from collisions accumulates around Earth, making it nearly impossible to launch spacecraft without them being destroyed. While Kessler syndrome unfolds over decades, the researchers wanted to show how quickly a crisis could begin. To do this, they introduced a new measurement called the Collision Realization and Significant Harm (CRASH) Clock.\nUsing this metric, the authors calculated that as of June 2025, a complete loss of command over satellite avoidance maneuvers would result in a catastrophic collision in about 2.8 days. In contrast, similar conditions in 2018, before the rise of mega constellations, would have allowed roughly 121 days before such a collision occurred. The risk becomes even more alarming over shorter periods. Losing control for just 24 hours carries a 30% chance of a major collision that could kick off the long chain reaction leading to Kessler syndrome.\nLittle Warning and Few Options\nOne of the most troubling aspects of solar storms is how little notice they provide. In many cases, warnings come only a day or two in advance. Even with that notice, there are limited actions operators can take beyond trying to protect vulnerable systems. Solar storms create a rapidly changing atmospheric environment that requires constant, real time monitoring and control. If that real time control is lost, the paper suggests there may be only a few days to restore it before the entire system collapses.\nThis concern is not hypothetical. The 2024 Gannon Storm was the strongest solar storm in decades, but it was not the most powerful on record. That distinction belongs to the Carrington Event of 1859. If a storm of similar strength occurred today, it could disrupt satellite control for far longer than three days. A single event like this, which has already happened once in recorded history, could severely damage global satellite infrastructure and confine humanity to Earth for the foreseeable future.\nWeighing the Risks of a Connected Sky\nFew readers would welcome a future cut off from space. While satellite mega constellations offer enormous technological benefits, they also introduce serious long term risks. A realistic understanding of those dangers is essential. When the potential outcome includes losing access to space for generations due to one extreme solar storm, informed decision making becomes critical. This research provides a clearer picture of what is at stake and why the risks can no longer be ignored.\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by Universe Today. Original written by Andy Tomaswick.

A new study proposes that dark starsâhypothetical stars powered by dark matterâcould tie all these surprises together. These exotic objects may have grown huge very quickly, lighting up the early cosmos and planting the seeds of supermassive black holes.\n- Share:\nA new study led by Colgate Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy Cosmin Ilie, working with Jillian Paulin '23 of the University of Pennsylvania, Andreea Petric of the Space Telescope Science Institute, and Katherine Freese of the University of Texas at Austin, proposes a single idea that could address three major mysteries from the universe's earliest era. The researchers suggest that dark stars may help explain the appearance of unexpectedly bright \"blue monster\" galaxies, the presence of very massive black holes at extremely early times, and the strange objects known as \"little red dots\" seen in images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\nThe earliest stars formed in regions dominated by dark matter, specifically at the centers of small dark matter structures called microhalos. Several hundred million light-years after the Big Bang, clouds made of hydrogen and helium cooled enough to begin collapsing under their own gravity. This process led to the birth of the first stars and marked the start of the cosmic dawn, a formative period in the universe's history.\nDuring this time, conditions may have allowed a rare type of star to form. These stars could be powered not only by nuclear fusion, but also by energy released when dark matter particles annihilate. Known as dark stars, such objects could grow to enormous sizes and may naturally evolve into the seeds that later become supermassive black holes.\nJWST Reveals Unexpected Early Galaxies\nJWST has now observed the most distant objects ever studied, offering an unprecedented look at the early universe. These observations have challenged long standing theories about how the first stars and galaxies formed. One of the most surprising findings is a large population of galaxies known as \"blue monsters.\" These galaxies are extremely bright, very compact, and contain little to no dust.\nBefore JWST, no simulations or theoretical models predicted that galaxies with these properties should exist so early in cosmic history. Their discovery has forced astronomers to reconsider how quickly stars and galaxies could have formed.\nOvermassive Black Holes and Little Red Dots\nJWST data have also intensified an ongoing mystery involving supermassive black holes. Some of the earliest observed galaxies appear to host black holes that are far larger than expected for their age. Explaining how the seeds of these larger-than-expected supermassive black holes (SMBHs) formed so quickly remains a major challenge.\nIn addition, JWST has revealed a new category of compact objects known as \"little red dots\" (LRDs). These dust-free sources date back to cosmic dawn and are unusual because they emit little to no X-ray radiation, something astronomers did not anticipate based on existing models.\nWhy Current Models Fall Short\nTaken together, the blue monster galaxies, early overmassive black holes, and little red dots point to serious gaps in pre-JWST theories of early galaxy and black hole formation. The findings suggest that widely accepted models need substantial updates to account for what JWST is now seeing.\n\"Some of the most significant mysteries posed by the JWST's cosmic dawn data are in fact features of the dark star theory,\" Ilie said.\nGrowing Evidence for Dark Stars\nAlthough dark stars have not yet been confirmed through direct observation, the new study strengthens the case for their existence. It builds on photometric and spectroscopic dark star candidates identified in two separate PNAS studies published in 2023 and 2025, respectively.\nThe authors describe in detail how dark stars could account for the properties of blue monster galaxies, little red dots, and early galaxies hosting massive black holes. The paper also presents the most recent spectroscopic analysis, reporting evidence for distinctive helium absorption features in the spectrum of JADES-GS-13-0. A similar feature had previously been identified in JADES-GS-14-0.\nWhy Dark Stars Matter\nDark stars are among the most intriguing theoretical objects in modern astrophysics. If confirmed, they could offer a way to directly probe the properties of dark matter particles. This would complement ongoing efforts to detect dark matter in laboratory experiments on Earth, whether through direct detection or particle production, and could help connect cosmic observations with fundamental physics.\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by Colgate University.

          "content": "NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has topped itself once again, delivering on its promise to push the boundaries of the observable universe closer to cosmic dawn with the confirmation of a bright galaxy that existed 280 million years after the big bang. By now Webb has established that it will eventually surpass virtually every benchmark it sets in these early years, but the newly confirmed galaxy, MoM-z14, holds intriguing clues to the universe’s historical timeline and just how different a place the early universe was than astronomers expected.\n“With Webb, we are able to see farther than humans ever have before, and it looks nothing like what we predicted, which is both challenging and exciting,” said Rohan Naidu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, lead author of a paper on galaxy MoM-z14 published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics.\nDue to the expansion of the universe that is driven by dark energy, discussion of physical distances and “years ago” becomes tricky when looking this far. Using Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instrument, astronomers confirmed that MoM-z14 has a cosmological redshift of 14.44, meaning that its light has been travelling through (expanding) space, being stretched and “shifted” to longer, redder wavelengths, for about 13.5 of the universe’s estimated 13.8 billion years of existence.\n“We can estimate the distance of galaxies from images, but it’s really important to follow up and confirm with more detailed spectroscopy so that we know exactly what we are seeing, and when,” said Pascal Oesch of the University of Geneva, co-principal investigator of the survey.\nImage: COSMOS Field MoM-z14 Galaxy (NIRCam Image)\nIntriguing Features\nMoM-z14 is one of a growing group of surprisingly bright galaxies in the early universe – 100 times more than theoretical studies predicted before the launch of Webb, according to the research team.\n“There is a growing chasm between theory and observation related to the early universe, which presents compelling questions to be explored going forward,” said Jacob Shen, a postdoctoral researcher at MIT and a member of the research team.\nOne place researchers and theorists can look for answers is the oldest population of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. A small percentage of these stars have shown high amounts of nitrogen, which is also showing up in some of Webb’s observations of early galaxies, including MoM-z14.\n“We can take a page from archeology and look at these ancient stars in our own galaxy like fossils from the early universe, except in astronomy we are lucky enough to have Webb seeing so far that we also have direct information about galaxies during that time. It turns out we are seeing some of the same features, like this unusual nitrogen enrichment,” said Naidu.\nWith galaxy MoM-z14 existing only 280 million years after the big bang, there was not enough time for generations of stars to produce such high amounts of nitrogen in the way that astronomers would expect. One theory the researchers note is that the dense environment of the early universe resulted in supermassive stars capable of producing more nitrogen than any stars observed in the local universe.\nThe galaxy MoM-z14 also shows signs of clearing out the thick, primordial hydrogen fog of the early universe in the space around itself. One of the reasons Webb was originally built was to define the timeline for this “clearing” period of cosmic history, which astronomers call reionization. This is when early stars produced light of high enough energy to break through the dense hydrogen gas of the early universe and begin travelling through space, eventually making its way to Webb, and us. Galaxy MoM-z14 provides another clue for mapping out the timeline of reionization, work that was not possible until Webb lifted the veil on this era of the universe.\nLegacy of Discovery Continues\nEven before Webb’s launch, there were hints that something very unanticipated happened in the early universe, when NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope discovered the bright galaxy GN-z11 400 million years after the big bang. Webb confirmed the galaxy’s distance — at the time the most distant ever. From there Webb has continued to push back farther and farther in space and time, finding more surprisingly bright galaxies like GN-z11.\nAs Webb continues to uncover more of these unexpectedly luminous galaxies, it’s clear that the first few were not a fluke. Astronomers are eagerly anticipating that NASA’s upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, with its combination of high-resolution infrared imaging and extremely wide field of view, will boost the sample of these bright, compact, chemically enriched early galaxies into the thousands.\n“To figure out what is going on in the early universe, we really need more information —more detailed observations with Webb, and more galaxies to see where the common features are, which Roman will be able to provide,” said Yijia Li, a graduate student at the Pennsylvania State University and a member of the research team. “It’s an incredibly exciting time, with Webb revealing the early universe like never before and showing us how much there still is to discover.”\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is the world’s premier space science observatory. Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).\nTo learn more about Webb, visit:\nDownloads & Related Information\nThe following sections contain links to download this article's images and videos in all available resolutions followed by related information links, media contacts, and if available, research paper and Spanish translation links.",

          "content": "The hidden reason cancer immunotherapy often fails\nA hidden cancer escape route has been exposedâand everyday statins might help shut it down.\n- Date:\n- January 28, 2026\n- Source:\n- Fujita Health University\n- Summary:\n- Cancer immunotherapy has been a game-changer, but many tumors still find ways to slip past the immune system. New research reveals a hidden trick: cancer cells can package the immune-blocking protein PD-L1 into tiny particles that circulate through the body and weaken immunotherapyâs impact. Scientists in Japan discovered that a little-known protein, UBL3, controls this processâand surprisingly, common cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins can shut it down.\n- Share:\nCancer immunotherapy has reshaped cancer treatment by training the body's immune system to recognize and attack tumors. Drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, which target the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, have led to long-lasting responses in some patients and fueled optimism about durable cancer control. Yet for most people, these therapies do not deliver the same benefit. Tumors can adapt and develop ways to escape immune detection, limiting the effectiveness of treatment.\nThis challenge has pushed researchers to look beyond the tumor itself and examine broader mechanisms of immune resistance. Scientists are increasingly focused on how cancers suppress immune activity throughout the body, not just at the tumor site. One emerging area of interest involves small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), tiny particles released by cancer cells that can carry immunosuppressive molecules and weaken the immune response in ways that are still not fully understood.\nInvestigating How PD-L1 Is Packaged and Released\nTo better understand this process, a research team from Fujita Health University in Japan, led by Professor Kunihiro Tsuchida, worked with collaborators from Tokyo Medical University Hospital and Tokyo Medical University. Their goal was to uncover how PD-L1, a key immune checkpoint protein, is selectively loaded into sEVs and to determine whether this pathway could be targeted therapeutically.\nThe study, published in Scientific Reports, was built around a central unanswered question. \"Cancer cells release small extracellular vesicles containing PD-L1, which are thought to reduce the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy. However, how PD-L1 is sorted into these vesicles has remained unclear.\" Addressing this mystery became the foundation of the research.\nA New Molecular Player in Immune Resistance\nUsing a wide range of techniques, including molecular and cell biology, biochemical and pharmacological tests, patient-derived samples, and bioinformatics, the researchers identified ubiquitin-like 3 (UBL3) as a key factor controlling how PD-L1 is directed into sEVs.\nThey found that PD-L1 undergoes a previously unknown post-translational modification involving UBL3. This modification occurs through a disulfide bond and differs from the classical process of ubiquitination. Further experiments showed that a specific amino acid, cysteine 272 in the cytoplasmic region of PD-L1, is essential for this modification.\nWhen UBL3 levels were increased in cancer cells, the amount of PD-L1 packaged into sEVs rose sharply, even though total PD-L1 inside the cells remained unchanged. In contrast, reducing UBL3 levels led to a clear drop in PD-L1 being loaded into vesicles and released outside the cell. Together, these results confirmed that UBL3 plays a central role in directing PD-L1 into sEVs.\nStatins Interfere With a Key Immune Escape Pathway\nOne of the most striking findings came when the team examined drugs that might interfere with this process. They discovered that statins, which are widely prescribed to lower cholesterol, strongly block UBL3 modification. All clinically used statins tested in the study reduced UBL3 activity, lowered PD-L1 modification, and sharply decreased the amount of PD-L1 sorted into sEVs.\nThese effects occurred at very low drug concentrations that are achievable in patients and were not linked to toxic effects on cells. Importantly, blood samples from people with non-small cell lung cancer showed a similar pattern. Among patients with high tumor PD-L1 expression, those taking statins had significantly lower levels of PD-L1-containing sEVs in their blood compared with patients not using statins.\nFurther bioinformatic analysis revealed that the combined expression of UBL3 and PD-L1 was associated with survival outcomes in lung cancer patients. This finding highlights the potential clinical importance of this newly identified regulatory pathway.\nWhat This Means for Cancer Treatment\nTaken together, these results help explain why immune checkpoint inhibitors often fail and point to a practical way to improve their performance. The study uncovers a hidden mechanism by which cancer cells spread immunosuppressive PD-L1 through extracellular vesicles, allowing tumors to weaken immune responses far beyond their immediate environment.\nLinking this pathway to statins is especially important because these drugs are widely used, inexpensive, and generally safe. This raises the possibility that the findings could be translated into clinical practice relatively quickly. As the researchers note, \"In the long term, this research may lead to more effective and accessible cancer immunotherapies. It could help more patients benefit from immune checkpoint treatments, improving survival and quality of life in real-world settings.\"\nA New Target for Overcoming Immunotherapy Resistance\nIn summary, the study shows that UBL3-driven modification promotes the packaging of PD-L1 into sEVs and that statins can disrupt this process, reducing levels of circulating immunosuppressive PD-L1. By identifying vesicle-associated PD-L1 trafficking as a modifiable driver of immune escape, the research opens a promising new path for tackling resistance to cancer immunotherapy. Adding statins to combination treatment strategies could offer a simple, scalable way to improve outcomes for patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors.\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by Fujita Health University.

In the U.S., the vast majority of non-hospitalized patients described brain fog, depression, and anxiety, while far fewer patients in countries like India and Nigeria reported the same issues. The difference doesnât appear to be about the virus itself, but about culture, stigma, and access to mental health care.\n- Share:\nAn international study found that U.S. long COVID patients report far more brain fog and psychological symptoms than patients in lower-income countries. Researchers believe the gap is driven by culture and healthcare access, not biology -- hinting that millions worldwide may be struggling unseen.\n- A large study of more than 3,100 people is the first to directly compare long COVID brain symptoms across multiple continents\n- Brain fog was reported by 86% of non-hospitalized patients in the U.S., compared with just 15% of patients in India\n- Researchers found that long COVID symptom patterns were linked more closely to income level than to geographic location\n- The striking differences are most likely driven by culture and access to healthcare, rather than differences in the virus itself\nLong COVID Brain Symptoms Vary Sharply Across Countries\nPeople with long COVID in the United States report much higher rates of brain fog, depression, and cognitive problems than patients in countries such as India and Nigeria, according to a large international study led by Northwestern Medicine.\nResearchers caution that these differences do not necessarily mean Americans experience more severe illness. Instead, the higher symptom burden reported in the U.S. may reflect greater access to neurological and mental health care, along with lower stigma around discussing cognitive and emotional symptoms.\nFirst Cross-Continental Comparison of Long COVID Neurology\nThe research represents the first study to directly compare neurological symptoms of long COVID across continents. Scientists followed more than 3,100 adults with long COVID who were evaluated at academic medical centers in Chicago; Medellín, Colombia; Lagos, Nigeria; and Jaipur, India.\nMost participants were not hospitalized during their initial COVID infections. Within this group, 86% of U.S. patients reported experiencing brain fog. By comparison, brain fog was reported by 63% of patients in Nigeria, 62% in Colombia, and just 15% in India.\nMental health symptoms followed a similar pattern. Nearly 75% of non-hospitalized patients in the U.S. reported depression or anxiety. In Colombia, that figure dropped to about 40%, while fewer than 20% of patients in Nigeria and India reported similar distress.\nCultural Attitudes Shape Symptom Reporting\n\"It is culturally accepted in the U.S. and Colombia to talk about mental health and cognitive issues, whereas that is not the case in Nigeria and India,\" said Dr. Igor Koralnik, senior study author and chief of neuro-infectious disease and global neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\"Cultural denial of mood disorder symptoms as well as a combination of stigma, misperceptions, religiosity and belief systems, and lack of health literacy may contribute to biased reporting. This may be compounded by a dearth of mental health providers and perceived treatment options in those countries.\"\nThe study was published today (Jan. 28) in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience.\nKey Neurological Findings Across All Regions\nAcross every country studied, the most frequently reported neurological symptoms included brain fog, fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), headache, dizziness, and sensory disturbances (such as numbness or tingling).\nSleep problems also varied widely. Nearly 60% of non-hospitalized U.S. patients reported insomnia, compared with roughly one-third or fewer of patients in Colombia, Nigeria, and India.\nWhen researchers analyzed symptom patterns statistically, they found a clear divide between high- and upper-middle-income countries such as the U.S. and Colombia and lower-middle-income countries such as Nigeria and India.\nHow the Study Was Conducted\nThe observational study enrolled adults with ongoing neurological symptoms following COVID-19 infection between 2020 and 2025. Participants were recruited from four academic medical centers and included both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients.\nSymptoms were evaluated using standardized neurological, cognitive, and quality-of-life assessments available at each site, allowing researchers to compare results across regions.\nWhy Long COVID Remains a Global Concern\nLong COVID affects millions of people worldwide and is defined by symptoms that continue for weeks or even years after an initial COVID infection. Estimates suggest that 10-30% of adults who contract COVID develop lasting symptoms, with cognitive and neurological issues among the most disruptive.\nAs the authors write, long COVID \"affects young and middle-aged adults in their prime, causing significant detrimental impact on the workforce, productivity and innovation all over the world.\"\nIn this study, patients in the U.S. consistently reported the greatest neurological and psychological burden, which \"affected their quality of life and ability to work,\" according to Koralnik, who also serves as co-director of the Comprehensive COVID Center at Northwestern Medicine and leads the global neurology program at the Havey Institute for Global Health at Feinberg.\nWhat the Findings Mean Going Forward\nThe researchers say their results highlight the importance of culturally sensitive screening tools and diagnostic approaches for long COVID. They also point to the need for healthcare systems that can support long-term care and follow-up.\nBuilding on these findings, Koralnik and his international collaborators are now testing cognitive rehabilitation treatments for long COVID brain fog in Colombia and Nigeria. These studies use the same treatment protocols developed for patients at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago.\nThe study is titled \"A cross-continental comparative analysis of the neurological manifestations of Long COVID.\"\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by Northwestern University.

Scientists identified the mites as a new species, marking the first record of its family in Brazil. The larvae attach to juvenile spiders and feed on lymph through a weak spot in the spiderâs body. The discovery came from long-stored specimens, suggesting many more species remain hidden in collections.\n- Share:\nResearchers examining spiders and scorpions at the Zoological Collections Laboratory of the Butantan Institute in São Paulo, Brazil, noticed something unusual on a spider only a few millimeters long. The animal appeared to be wearing a delicate pearl necklace. Unsure of what they were seeing, the team turned to a colleague who specializes in mites for answers.\nRicardo Bassini-Silva, a researcher and curator of the laboratory's Acarological Collection, quickly recognized that the bead-like structures were actually mite larvae. Until now, Brazil had only one documented case of mites that parasitize spiders, and that species belonged to a completely different family.\nA New Parasitic Mite Identified\nDetailed analysis of the spider and its tiny passengers followed. Using light microscopy, scanning techniques, and other morphological examinations, the researchers confirmed they were looking at a new species. The finding represents the second spider-parasitic mite ever described in Brazil and the first from its family recorded in the country.\nThe research was supported by FAPESP and published in the International Journal of Acarology. It brought together two FAPESP-funded projects. One is led by Bassini-Silva, while the other is coordinated by Fernando de Castro Jacinavicius, a co-author of the study and a professor at the Institute of Biology at the University of São Paulo (IB-USP).\nExpanding the Map of a Rare Genus\nThe newly identified species, named Araneothrombium brasiliensis, belongs to a genus first described in Costa Rica in 2017. Finding it in Brazil suggests the group may be more widespread than previously thought and could exist in other neotropical regions.\nEach mite larva measures about 500 micrometers, or half a millimeter. The spiders they parasitize are only a few millimeters long. So far, scientists have identified only the larval stage of the mite. These larvae were found attached to juvenile spiders from three different families. All collected specimens were engorged, showing they had fed enough to significantly increase their size.\n\"For this group of mites, it isn't uncommon to know many parasitic species only through their larvae, since in adulthood they become free-living predators, living in the soil and feeding on small insects and even other mites, which makes them very difficult to find,\" says Bassini-Silva.\nWhere the Parasitized Spiders Were Found\nThe spiders carrying the newly described mites were collected in Pinheiral, a municipality in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The area is located near caves and grottos, an environment similar to where Brazil's first known spider-parasitic mite species, Charletonia rocciai, was discovered.\nIn a separate study published in 2022, researchers revisited that earlier species, which was originally described in 1979. The updated work added new details about its physical traits, biology, geographic distribution, and host organisms, including spiders.\nWhy the Mites Target a Spider's Weak Spot\nSpider-parasitic mites feed on lymph, a fluid that circulates through the bodies of certain arthropods. They draw out this fluid through the pedicel, the narrow region connecting the cephalothorax (where the spider's eyes and mouth are located) to the abdomen.\n\"This is the spider's most vulnerable region since other parts have a lot of chitin, which forms an exoskeleton difficult for the mites' fangs to penetrate,\" the researcher explains.\nThe mites' tendency to latch onto juvenile spiders suggests opportunistic behavior, since younger spiders are more exposed to parasites and predators. Researchers also note that the species may not be limited to spiders. It could potentially parasitize other arthropods, including insects. This broader behavior has already been observed in Charletonia rocciai, which feeds on at least two different insect orders.\nHidden Biodiversity in Museum Collections\n\"With more than 3,000 species of spiders alone, Brazil has immense potential for discovering new parasitic mites,\" says Bassini-Silva.\nThe discovery also underscores the value of zoological collections for biodiversity research. The spiders examined in this study had been stored for years, and the mites went unnoticed until now. According to Bassini-Silva, collaborations with field researchers and environmental consulting companies may soon lead to more samples. He hopes these efforts will result in the identification and description of additional mite species associated with a wide range of animals.\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo.

The heavy snow, along with bitterly cold temperatures, sleet, and ice, created treacherous travel conditions, toppled power lines, and caused widespread school closures, according to news reports.\nOn the afternoon of January 26, the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) on the Suomi NPP satellite observed new snow covering a large swath of the country. The left image is natural color, while the false-color image on the right uses a combination of visible and infrared light (bands M11-I2-I1) to distinguish snow (blue) from clouds (white).\nPreliminary National Weather Service data indicate snow accumulations of up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) in parts of Oklahoma between the mornings of January 23 and January 26, with higher accumulation across the Midwest and in New England. Totals of around 20 inches were reported in several Northeast states.\nSome locations were digging out from record daily accumulations, including 5.1 inches in St. Louis, Missouri, on January 24, and 11.2 inches in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 25. Several inches of snow and sleet also fell in parts of North Texas, a rare occurrence for the area.

          "content": "Autobiography of a “Jeep” (1943)\n“Can this be an automobile?”\n“Looks more like a four-wheeled beetle.”\nThe literal “auto”-biographical narrator of this 1943 World War II propaganda film is quite honest with us that these kinds of comments once shook his self-confidence. In a world of elegant coupes and sedans full of gadgets, of cars more “debutante” than machine, what was there to be impressed by in a boxy little open-topped thing such as himself?\nThose past cars were all about style, but it’s wartime now. The army’s getting tough, and so cars have to get tougher. The Jeep (named for “GP”, the military designation of “general purpose”, our narrator claims) gets put through his paces: driving through shoulder-deep water, across moguls, through underbrush, hauling artillery, towing gliders, even getting rowed across a river in a custom canvas wrapper. Let’s see a Lincoln Continental do all that!\nOur narrator is not just a Jeep but “Jeep” itself — when he passes his tests, he is thrilled that he “found myself in mass production. I was getting turned out one every two minutes. Thirty Jeeps a minute, what do you think of that!” He becomes ubiquitous, omnipresent, both at the start of the parade and the end of the battle. He gets to simultaneously raise money for war bonds in Washington, D.C., with Claudette Colbert and drive through New Guinea with General MacArthur and join victory parades in North Africa. All alongside his “pal” — the American soldier.\nBut it’s not those soldiers he’s talking to. Given voice by the Office of War Information’s Overseas Film Unit under the direction of Irving Lerner, a later-blacklisted left-wing documentarian, our Jeep is presenting himself to the people of the world. “Jeep” is the idea that will defeat America’s enemies, repeatedly instantiated in the more than 600,000 units that rolled off Ford, Willys-Overland, and American Bantam assembly lines between 1941 and 1945.\nHe doesn’t even know that General George Marshall would supposedly later call him “America’s greatest contribution to modern warfare,” but how can he have ever doubted himself?\n“I was a success! But the thing that makes me a success most of all is this: I made a friend — I mean the soldier. Wherever you see one of us, the other one won’t be far behind. That goes for now, when we’re fighting together, and for after the war, when we’ll be building together. Because the rumor is going around that the Jeep is here to stay!” The Jeep was here to stay, but not just for postwar reconstruction: it would subsequently be deployed in Korea, Vietnam, and various other conflicts across the twentieth century. “No matter what they asked me to do”, snarls the Jeep at one point in the film, “it was no worse than what my driver was ready to do himself.”\nEnjoyed this piece?

          "content": "Cybernetic Attention All Watched over by Machines We Learned to Watch\nBefore the attention economy consumed our lives, “pursuit tests” devised by the US military coupled man to machine with the aim of assessing focus under pressure. D. Graham Burnett explores these devices for evaluating aviators, finding a pre-history of the laboratory research that has relentlessly worked to slice and dice the attentional powers of human beings.\nJanuary 21, 2026\nWe worry about our attention these days — nearly all of us. There is something. . . wrong. We cannot manage to do what we want to do with our eyes and minds — not for long, anyway. We keep coming back to the machines, to the screens, to the notifications, to the blinking cursor and the frictionless swipe that renews the feed.\nAn ethnographer from Mars, moving among us (would we even notice?), might have trouble understanding our complaint: “Trouble with their attention? They stare at small slabs of versicolor glass all day! Their attentive powers are. . . sublime!”\nAnd that misunderstanding rather sharpens the point: we don’t have any problem at all with the forms of attention that involve remaining engaged with, and responsive to, machines. We are amazing at the click and tap of durational vigilance to this or that stimulus, presented at the business end of a complex device. Our uncanny and immersive cybernetic attention is a defining characteristic of the age. Our human attention — our ability to be with ourselves and with others, our ability to receive the world with our minds and senses, our ability to daydream, read a book uninterrupted, or watch a sunset — well, many of us are finding it increasingly difficult to remember what that might even mean.\nThis isn’t really an accident. Over the last century or so, a series of elaborate programs of laboratory research have worked to slice and dice the attentional powers of human beings. Their aim? To understand the operational capacities of those who would be asked to shoot down airplanes, monitor radar screens, and otherwise sit at the controls of large and expensive machines. Seated in front of countless instruments, experimental subjects were asked to listen and look, to track and trigger. Psychologists stood by with stopwatches, quantifying our cybernetic capacities, and seeking ways to extend them. For those of us who have come of age in the fluorescence of the “attention economy”, it is interesting to look back and try to catch glimpses of the way that the movement of human eyeballs came under precise scrutiny, the way that machine vigilance became a field of study. We know now that the mechanomorphic attention dissected in those laboratories is the machine attention that is relentlessly priced in our online lives — to deleterious effects.\nYou could say that this process began with the fascinating and now mostly forgotten tool known as the “pursuit test”. Part steampunk videogame, part laboratory snuff-flick, the pursuit test staged and restaged the integration of man and machine across the first decades of the twentieth century.\nThis photograph depicts an early example of these devices, an elaborate apparatus developed by the mechanically minded American psychologist Knight Dunlap (1875–1949) during his work at the Medical Research Laboratory of the Air Service during World War I. We can think of it as a “beta build” of the pursuit test — an attention training system, used to assess aviators.\nDunlap was particularly and vocally concerned about the attentional capacities of airmen — especially under the extreme physiological conditions of combat-oriented powered flight. It is abundantly clear that he thought attention was of the utmost importance in the world of the military. Attention was also, as he saw it, one of the key domains in which the science of psychology could directly assist in the selection and training of combat aviators:\nNot only the extent to which the flier can subordinate all other reactions to the vital reaction of the moment, and the length of time during which the vitally important details of the situation which confronts him can continue to dominate his nervous system in spite of distractions (the power of sustaining attention, as we commonly express it); but also the proper balance in integration (the power of attending efficiently to several distinct details in a situation), need to be studied very carefully.1\nThe system that Dunlap developed to test this general attentive “integration” was a kind of attentional stress-test. How did it work? A plate of fourteen stimulus lights was set up in front of the subject, along with fourteen small brass pins. Every time one of these lights turned on, the subject had to use a small metal stylus to touch the adjacent pin. Those pins, however, were each surrounded by a metal washer, and a sloppy gesture that nicked the washer amounted to a “fail” — and tallied an error. This part of the system worked a bit like a high-stakes version of the children’s game known as “Operation”. But that was not all. The full test panel also included a small amp-meter, which had been wired into a pair of rheostats: one controlled by the experimenter, the other controlled by the subject. These could be used to offset each other, so that as the experimenter pulled the needle of the amp-meter one way, the subject could, by manipulating his little dial, correct the needle back to center. And there was yet a third “problem” for the cadet to address (concurrently): a small motor sat on the table, and the experimenter could throw a switch that markedly reduced its running speed; the subject tried to restore its rate by depressing a pedal placed under the table.\nAcross twenty-five minutes, the cadet worked to monitor the lighted panel, keep the motor running at full speed, and hold the amp-meter needle at equilibrium while slowly. . . being deprived of oxygen — which definitely made it harder! (The subject wore a “rebreather” — a closed-loop respiration system that amounts to a gradual asphyxiation machine.)\nExperimental psychologists like Dunlap, working with early aviators, began to refigure their laboratory systems of attention-scrutiny as dynamic, scalar, and ultimately programmable instruments capable of monitoring and assessing long sequences of focused control.2 The pursuit tests were a direct result of this new attention problem.\nDunlap’s early device pitted the subject “against” the actual experimenter (who controlled the amp-meter to which the subject had to respond). But the next generation of pursuit tests automated the stimulus, and thus set the human subject against purely machinic trials. The most prominent of these was the Miles “Pursuitmeter”, invented by the American psychologist Walter R. Miles (1885–1978) in the early 1920s.\nA first-class tinkerer in the laboratory, Miles would be remembered by his eulogists as a “gadgeteer supreme” of psychology across the first half of the twentieth century.3 With his irrepressible penchant for design, Miles invented a remarkable device that can be understood as the progenitor of a long line of increasingly sophisticated analogue feedback systems that would be used to train and assess the human capacity to enter into an intimate relationship with a dynamic mechanical apparatus. At the heart of the Pursuitmeter was a simple slit-sight, on which the subject focused all his attention.\nThe vertical white line is painted on the face of the slit-window. But the white dot bisecting that white line is motile, and drifts right and left, seemingly at random, over the course of an experimental run (it is driven by an internal clockwork program). The test subject, looking on, can “correct” these drifts by sliding the rheostat handle (“F”) to the right or left in such a way as to compensate for the dot’s departures. A recording device (not seen here) maintains a paper record of the location of the “cursor” in relation to the “crosshair” — a distance that was understood to correlate negatively with the focus and dexterity of the subject, who endeavors to keep the system “on target” as much as possible for the duration of the test.4\nIn the photograph above, the subject is again undergoing one of a series of “asphyxiation” experiments designed to assess his capacities for sustained attention and motor response under conditions of reduced oxygenation (a standard problem for aviators flying without the assistance of supplemental oxygen, which only came into meaningful use after World War II).\nSuch a system created an uncanny (and novel) test-station for cybernetic integration. The Pursuitmeter manifestly staged a drawn-out dance of eye, hand, mind, and machine. Indeed, one can think of it as a remarkable inversion of the ordinary situation of a true “helmsman” (the Ancient Greek kybernētēs, from which “cybernetics” is derived). Whereas the pilot of an airplane provides regulating inputs that steer a system that is responding to real-time perturbations in the world, the Pursuitmeter flips the script; the machine “steers” its human through a set of reactions encoded in its program, assessing the human capacity to follow mechanical instructions. It is, in some sense, a “simulation” of the general problem of spatiotemporal homeostasis — keeping things on their keel. In another sense, however, it is robotic Simon Says.\nThe Miles Pursuitmeter, then, with its intricately programmed “disturber” circuitry of mechanically manipulated induction coils, and its continuous monitoring/recording of performance, represented a fully automated testing system. It charged those before it to give durational, focused attention to a percept, and the device kept track of each subject’s ability to follow and respond to a series of cues.\nLooking at that subject, eyes fixed on the cursor, fingers tracking its movement — as his vision blurs and his consciousness gradually clouds into a hazy trance — we catch a glimpse of the future, of ourselves, eyes glazed, slipping ever deeper into the machine zone. This is not an accident. It is the result of a long history of placing humans in front of machines — and asking them to keep up.\n***\nWe worry about our attention these days. But what we mostly worry about is cybernetic attention, the attention of the pursuit tests — our eyes on the stimulus, our fingers moving responsively. And there is, in fact, a direct line that links those pilot-testing contraptions to the click and tap of our modern attention economy. Pursuit tests were part of the history of experimental psychology — part of the laboratory efforts to quantify and measure the sensory and psychic features of the human person. Attention rose to prominence in this enterprise early, and the kind of attention that came under scrutiny in those laboratories was an instrumental, operational attention — the kind that could be elicited and assessed by instruments. For all the significance of these forms of attention in the machine ecologies of the military industrial complex, it was in the emerging big-money world of advertising that these tools found their most consequential application: from the Neilsen “audiometer” that monitored the radio dials of Americans, to the increasingly powerful eye-tracking systems that quantified the “attention value” of each glance, the metrical mechanisms of attention monitoring became the engines of the attention economy.\nIs all that quick-twitch scrutiny, all that durational commitment to machine interfaces, actually “attention”? Yes and no. You can certainly call those behavior capacities of the human animal “attention”, and you can generate a lot of peer reviewed scientific literature about that kind of attention — precisely because it is easy to measure, and therefore lends itself to the forms of quantitative analysis prized in science and medicine. However, reading, too, is an attentional act, but it is harder to assess in quantitative terms. Not impossible. But difficult. And love. Love, too, is an act of attention. And it quantifies very badly indeed.\nHow do we address the “attention crisis” of our moment? The intense “human fracking” of the AI-driven attention economy? One way to move forward is to take a moment to remember that cybernetic attention is. . . just that. And human attention is something else. Step away from the pervasive pursuit tests of late modernity, and see what happens.\nD. Graham Burnett is based in New York City. He writes and makes things.

          "content": "Flights of Fancy: The Nine Birds of Jacques de Fornazeris (1594)\nIn 1594, the engraver Jacques de Fornazeris created a striking flight of nine bird portraits. The series marries technical flair with theatrical charm: the specimens are rendered in rich detail and possess a noticeable vitality. A fierce civetta (little owl), barbagianni (barn owl), gallo (rooster), pavone (peacock), pernice (partridge), aquila de corona (crowned eagle), anatra saluatica (duck), fagiano (pheasant), and a pelican-like bird described as a sacco marino all feature here. Each poses, glaring beneath its label, accompanied by contextual vegetation and the occasional familiar — frogs, crabs, butterflies, caterpillars, or smaller birds — in frame. Fornazeris collaborated with the prolific Flemish engraver-publisher Nicolaus van Aelst, who normally specialized in religious and allegorical scenes, to print and distribute the plates.\nBird studies experienced a boom in the late sixteenth century. As MET curator Femke Speelberg writes, “the growing demand for empirical evidence and widespread collecting interests by scholars and wealthy patrons alike encouraged a greater number of artists to specialize in this practice.” Yet while natural historical images of avian life by sixteenth-century artists like Jacques Le Moyne sought to document tonal and physical accuracy, the prints by Fornazeris have a slightly more playful quality. Often staring directly at the viewer, or interacting somewhat comically with their familiars, Fornazeris’ birds perform for their audience. This is not nature overseen; the animals seem always already part of a cultural world.\nLittle is known about Fornazeris himself, but he appears to have been multitalented, working as a draughtsman, printmaker, and publisher. Possibly born in Piedmont, he honed his craft at the Savoy court in Turin before settling in Lyon around 1600, where he remained until his death circa 1619. As art historian Henriette Pommier writes, Fornazeris was “conversant with the refined flemish burin technique, which was not yet widespread in single-sheet engraving, but whose delicate nuances in contrast to the more schematic, elementary treatment of the woodcut, must have certainly impressed potential clients.” He was best known for his frontispieces and engravings of popes and nobles, including two plates of Marie de’ Medici, and collaborated from 1601 until his death in 1619 with the bookseller Horace Cardon. However, he had previously produced a collection of twelve or more smaller landscape bird engravings in a similar style between 1580 and 1590, and potentially a few mammals, such as a lynx — though this is a speculative attribution.\nEnjoyed this piece?

          "content": "A Prophet of the Weather: Lantern Slides by Clement Lindley Wragge (ca. 1900–22)\nBetween 1900 and 1922, Theosophist and meteorologist Clement Lindley Wragge gave countless magic lantern lectures, with titles like: “A Voyage through the Universe” (1902), “The Majesty of Creation” (1906), “The Grandeur of the Universe” (1912), and “The Endless Universe and Eternal Life” (1918–22). The images collected below were recovered from a trove of 350 lantern slides stored in wooden boxes, which were used by Wragge in various lecture series and are now held in the collections of the Auckland War Memorial Museum. Without extant transcripts for many of these presentations, we are left to imagine his transitions based solely on the images: eclipses and solar flares give way to flocks of sheep and esoteric wisdom; sunsets fade into saturnine moonscapes; a chicken lays an egg and, shortly after, a subsequent slide asks: “Who am I? Who are you?”\nBorn in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, Clement Lindley Wragge (1852–1922) was orphaned at an early age: his mother passed away from complications of childbirth; his father fell off a horse and died from the resultant injuries. Raised for a time by his grandmother, who taught him the basics of cosmology and meteorology, Wragge initially studied law at Lincoln’s Inn before receiving a minor inheritance, which allowed him to decamp for North Africa and the Levant. In 1874, he toured Egypt, Palestine, and Jerusalem, where he chatted with a group of Mormons who encouraged him to visit Utah. And he did so the following year, sailing first to India and then Australia and finally to San Francisco and Salt Lake City. There, he met the prophet and governor Brigham Young, before heading home, surrendering his stake in the law, and casting his eyes to the sky.\nDuring 1881, Wragge assisted the Scottish Meteorological Society in their plans to establish a weather station on Ben Nevis, and began to earn a reputation — which would later result in being nicknamed The Weather Prophet — through his daily assent of the highest mountain in the British Isles, winning the Society’s gold medal in 1882. Two years later, Wragge and his wife and scientific collaborator, Leonora Edith Florence d’Eresby Thornton — whom he had met during yet another trip to Australia in 1876 — decided to return to Oceania for good, setting sail in 1884 with their dog, Renzo, and a supposedly hot-headed cat in tow. In Australia and New Zealand, Wragge devoted himself to rain and wind. He founded the Royal Meteorological Society of Australasia as well as a slew of weather stations (on Mount Lofty near Adelaide; close to the summit of Tasmania’s Mount Wellington; on Mount Kosciuszko in New South Wales), published Wragge’s Australasian Almanac and Weather Guide for Land and Sea between 1898 and 1903, and was appointed as government meteorologist for Queensland in 1887.\nHis most famous exploit, however, was a failure. Having purchased a battery of Steiger Vortex canons, which had been invented to prevent hail from forming over vineyards in Europe, Wragge installed six in Charleville, Queensland, and proclaimed that he would end the drought of 1902. His solution? Fire these cannon-like devices at clouds and watch as the acoustic shockwaves produced by their gas explosions resulted in rain. While the first firing was met with a bit of drizzle, the second barrage produced no precipitation and two of the cannons exploded. When later interviewed about the flop, Wragge blamed his civilian assistants: “the people of Charleville did not carry out the experiment properly”, he said. “They only fired ten shots, whereas they should have continued firing for ten minutes, at the rate of two shots a minute from each gun.”\nIn later life, Wragge became increasingly attuned to the mystical climate of the inner world. He “believed in the underlying connection between knowledge and divinity or science and spirituality”, writes Shaun Higgins, pictorial curator at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. In 1908, during a tour of India, he met Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who founded the Ahmadiyya messianic movement in Islam, and together they conversed about the harmony of science and religion. In the early 1920s, Arthur Conan Doyle visited Wragge in New Zealand while writing The Wanderings of a Spiritualist and left convinced that Wragge was “the most remarkable personality in Auckland — dreamer, mystic, and yet very practical adviser on all matters of ocean and air.”\nWragge’s lecture style was grandiose, a rhetorical squall, a twister that gathered ideas from every discipline his mind roamed over. An observer of a 1902 lecture by Wragge described the meteorologist as embodying the very weather systems under his observation: “His voice comes in gusts, and dies away in murmurs; it occasionally travels with the speed of a small tornado”. The lecture prospectus for the Wragge Institute and Gardens, which opened at Birkenhead, Auckland, in 1916, offers a glimpse of the encyclopedic ambitions harbored by this Englishman, who sought to harmonize the farthest reaches of space with the inner depths of the soul: “astronomy, geography, travel, meteorology, natural history, radium, etc. besides lectures on Oriental and Indian philosophy, studies in the psychic and occult realms, practical gardening, and evolution of the beautiful and other subjects”.\nWhile the primary aim of his lectures was to make astronomical and meteorological discoveries accessible to the public, Wragge increasingly used his magic lantern slides to communicate Theosophical learning. During a 1908 lecture, for instance, Wragge describes scientific observation as a form of prayer: “Instead of going to church, I prefer to go out into the mighty universe and ask God for wisdom. Can we not pray in the open, in the forests, and by the rivers! (showing a picture of the Manawatu River.) Why can’t I pray in the Manawatu River?” According to Higgins, Wragge conceived of astronomy as “the universal religion, referring to its capacity to lift the mind beyond the finite. He certainly used this capacity in his lectures, persuading the audience to accept that they were insignificant in the scale of the universe.”\nBut this insignificance was meant to comfort. Themes from Wragge’s later lectures would be more at home in the realms of poetry and religion than textbooks on astronomy: the persistence of life after death, the survival of the soul. In these lectures, slides of “Atlantic ooze”, pictured at 2,500 fathoms, and the cratered surface of the Moon are ordered cheek by jowl with meditations on the infinitude of human consciousness:\nBelow you will find a selection of slides from across Wragge’s lecturing career. Slides marked “G” are from “The Grandeur of the Universe” (1912) lecture, while images marked “U” are from “The Endless Universe and Eternal Life” (1918–22), which recycled slides from previous lectures. Other slides are marked “O”, presumably for use in observatories, and “R”, a designation that the image concerns radium, an element that Wragge believed contained “the radio-active spark of God”.\nEnjoyed this piece?

          "content": "Peter Kropotkin’s Memoirs of a Revolutionist (1899)\n“Many a man and many a woman have accomplished a great life-work without having led a great life”, the influential Danish literary critic Georg Brandes wrote in his introduction to Peter Kropotkin’s 1899 Memoirs of a Revolutionist. “Many people are interesting, although their lives may have been quite insignificant and commonplace. Kropotkin’s life is both great and interesting”.\nBorn Prince Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin (1842–1921) into a prominent Moscow family, by the end of his life, he had served as Tsar Alexander II’s personal page; had reshaped scientific knowledge of Asian geology and the Ice Age; had been the first European to travel to the Greater Khingan Range; had seen the serfs emancipated; and had been jailed twice for his revolutionary politics. More famously, he was, by the end of the nineteenth century, one of the world’s leading anarchists. If that life, as captured in his memoirs, is as interesting as it is great, it is because Kropotkin is an anarchist propagandist as fascinated by science and art as the goings-on of the First International.\nOriginally serialized in The Atlantic in 1898, these Memoirs are a Bildungsroman for the anarchist intellectual. When the tsar’s brother, the Grand Duke Nicholas (1831–91), comes to visit Kropotkin in his jail cell in the infamous Peter and Paul Fortress in 1876, Kropotkin delights in the royal’s discomfiture. How could someone so close to the palace have thrown his lot in with the people who wanted to see it destroyed? “Were you such in the corps of pages?” the Grand Duke asks (his voice filled “with terror”, Kropotkin adds). “In the corps I was a boy”, Kropotkin responds, “and what is indefinite in boyhood grows definite in manhood”.\nKropotkin’s childhood is thus narrated to make his later crisis seem almost inevitable. Born in 1842, that childhood is spent among an aristocracy whose shortcomings are as apparent to him as they were to his contemporary Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910), another revolutionary dropout. Kropotkin’s father is distant to his sons and cruel to his serfs, forcing marriages and commanding floggings. Those serfs are, in contrast, much, much kinder to Kropotkin than they need to be.\nBut Kropotkin was young enough that his Europe, as later Russian exile Victor Serge (1890–1947) wrote in his own Memoirs of a Revolutionary, was still a place “where the ideal of liberty seemed to have some future”. And indeed we read how, when Alexander II issues the Emancipation Manifesto on March 3, 1861, Kropotkin and his fellow cadets rush to the hotbed of radical revolutionary energy in St. Petersburg — the Italian opera — and join in celebrations. “The same enthusiasm was in the streets”, he exclaims. A new Russia, perhaps, is dawning.\nThat hope, however, was short-lived, and Kropotkin has a front-row seat to the later disappointments of Alexander II’s reign: as the top student at the academy, he is assigned directly to the emperor as a page de chambre. His disgust with courtly life means that he eventually asks, in 1862, to be sent to eastern Siberia. In that little-populated, only-recently-annexed part of Russia, he sees how people can live without a state. It is here, finally, at the close of volume I, that he is “prepared to become an anarchist”.\nHis full conversion comes five years later, on a scientific expedition to Finland. He is considering whether to accept a position as the secretary of the Geographical Society when a revelation hits him, re-narrated some thirty years later with a characteristically vivid and sentimental urge to solidarity:\nThere, on the crest of that immense moraine which runs between the lakes, as if giants had heaped it up in a hurry to connect the two shores, there stands a Finnish peasant plunged in contemplation of the beautiful lakes, studded with islands, which lie before him. Not one of these peasants, poor and downtrodden though they may be, will pass this spot without stopping to admire the scene. Or there, on the shore of a lake, stands another peasant, and sings something so beautiful that the best musician would envy him his melody for its feeling and its meditative power. Both deeply feel, both meditate, both think; they are ready to widen their knowledge: only give it to them; only give them the means of getting leisure. This is the direction in which, and these are the kind of people for whom, I must work. All those sonorous phrases about making mankind progress, while at the same time the progressmakers stand aloof from those whom they pretend to push onwards, are mere sophisms made up by minds anxious to shake off a fretting contradiction.\nSo I sent my negative reply to the Geographical Society.\nOnce he has this realization, a return to normal life is impossible: he becomes a full-time revolutionist.\nNevertheless, Kropotkin is never quite able to abandon his scientific work. When word comes that the secret police is onto him, he has to delay his escape by a week, because he needs to be present for a debate about his work at the Geographical Society. The discussion concludes and everyone agrees he is right; unfortunately, a few days later, he is locked up without trial in the Peter and Paul Fortress. Yet science is also his relief from the horrors there: although ostensibly none of the prisoners are allowed books, pens, or paper, an exception is made for Kropotkin so he can finish his work on glaciers. (His self-sacrifice throughout is such that it is a relief to see him throw an aristocratic fit when his “silk undergarment” is confiscated by the prison administration.)\nHis friends spring him out in 1876, and he goes into exile first in England, where he earns money by writing articles for Nature, and then in Switzerland, where he begins printing his anarchist newspaper, Le Révolté (his passionate retelling of its founding is essential reading for anyone interested in DIY publishing). Kropotkin is arrested by the French in 1882, which only serves to make him more famous. Rumor has it (that is, Kropotkin alleges) that the nascent Franco-Russian alliance is conditioned on France keeping him locked up. But eventually he is freed, and off he travels to England, where he writes numerous books, including this memoir.\nHis valediction is a prediction: “a chance combination of accidental circumstances may bring about in Europe a revolution . . . a deep and rapid social reconstruction”. Fifteen years later, Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, and three years after that the Romanovs were too. Unfortunately for the Bolsheviks, Kropotkin was wrong that, in this new age, revolutions would no longer need to “assume the violent character which they took in times past”. But when he died in 1921, the anarchists were allowed to organize a massive funeral (with a eulogy by Emma Goldman). It would be the last major anarchist gathering in the Soviet Union.\nEnjoyed this piece?

Google, working under the motto “Don’t Be Evil,” had just dethroned Yahoo! as the planet’s most popular Internet search engine (AskJeeves was not available for comment). Nickelback was at the height of its fame. Internet Explorer was the most used web browser, by far. TamagotchiTM Connection was the must-have toy of the season. And in September of that year, a 27-year-old science and history nerd named Alan published Damn Interesting’s first article—Lake Peigneur: The Swirling Vortex of Doom. This month is our site’s twentieth birthday.\nI have been conflicted about how to observe the occasion. Initially we planned to just leave that note at the top of There Once Was a Man Called Curley—our writers are reluctant to bore everyone with uncompelling self-indulgence. At the same time, a decimally delicious date such as twenty seems plenty important, and the lack of a formal acknowledgement feels like a freshly missing tooth—a disconcerting vacancy that one’s tongue cannot stop probing. So this brief post stands in as something inadequate yet extant, much like Nickelback.\nIn the years since the first Damn Interesting article, much has changed in the world: Apple’s iPhone touched off the smartphone age; Twitter took flight; Facebook ate the Internet, and excreted something…else; Google released the Chrome web browser; Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin; astronomers downgraded Pluto to a dwarf planet; NASA retired the Space Shuttle; CERN discovered the Higgs Boson with the Large Hadron Collider; North Korea got nukes; Fukushima melted down; Osama Bin Laden was killed; Edward Snowden leaked; Google dropped their motto; Brexit broke Britain; COVID-19 paused the planet; James Webb got his Space Telescope; LIGO detected gravitational waves; astronomers detected our first interstellar visitor ʻOumuamua; we collectively made 1.7 billion new humans, give or take; and so on.\nIn that time, our small, independent crew of authors, editors, illustrators, and podcasters at Damn Interesting published 797,626 words (798,231 if you count this post), released 410 podcast episodes, curated over 45,000 interesting links, made a few games, won a few awards, published one paper book, served up zero ads, and gained twenty years of, let’s say, experience.\nHow about you? How have the past twenty years been? What are your aims for the next twenty? What would you like to see Damn Interesting do in the next two decades (apart from “publish more often” [which is impossible unless some of us gain financial freedom from our day jobs])? Should we add discussion to curated links? Make videos based on articles? Another paper book? More games? More short-form curios? A pop-up restaurant? A limited edition, Damn-Interesting-branded LabubuTM?\nFor posterity, some preposterous predictions for the next twenty years:\n- “AI” grows so powerful that it becomes nearly profitable\n- Astronomers discover Planet X1\n- Linguists discover a word that rhymes with “orange”2\n- The United States formally adopts the metric system3\n- Geneticists engineer convenient boneless chickens4\n- Humans establish a permanent moon base5\n- Vat-grown meat becomes commercially viable6\n- SETI detects a signal of extraterrestrial origin7\nWe hope you’re all taking care of yourselves in these strange times.

Consequently, the number 4 is considered by many people in East Asian nations to be unlucky. It is not unusual for buildings in that region to skip the number 4 when labeling floors, much in the same way 13th floors are omitted in some parts of the world2. In Hong Kong, at least one skyscraper avoids the proper numbering for floors 40-49.\nFour is the second-smallest positive non-prime number3. It is the only natural number where one can get the same result by multiplying its square roots (2×2), or adding them (2+2). Four happens to be the only number that has the same number of letters as its actual value4. The four color theorem tells us that four is an adequate number of colors for any two dimensional map—no two bordering regions would need to share a color. Four is the number of bonds that a carbon atom can make, which is why life can exist, a quality known as tetravalency. Fear of the number four is known as tetraphobia, and anyone suffering from it has almost certainly stopped reading by now, or at least uttered some four-letter words.\nIt’s no secret that direct donations to Damn Interesting have been on a downward trend in recent years, so we are aiming to diversify. To that end, we’ve made something new, and it’s called Omiword.\nWay back in the days before Covid, predating the Wordle craze, I started working on a daily browser-based game with draggable tiles and intersecting words. Whenever I have a small pocket of time, when it’s insufficient for a writing groove, I find that making games is a meditative way to occupy it. I shelved this game in 2020 when the world went weird, and I didn’t find my way back to it until recently. It’s ready now, and I hope some people like it.\nIn this game, the player’s objective is to spell four common American English words by dragging letter tiles within sectors. The puzzles start out easy on Mondays, and grow more difficult daily, becoming downright hostile by Sunday.\nIt’s totally free, though we’re hoping that some people who enjoy it will donate via Patreon to support ongoing puzzle design. If we reach $300/month in supporters there, we’ll commit the effort to add access to the entire archive of daily puzzles. There has been one puzzle per day since limited user testing began on 01 January 2025, so that’s over 200 puzzles in the archive so far.\nOmiword is not our first game, nor is it likely to be the last. Let us know what you think if you are so inclined, feedback is welcome. Money is also welcome, it’s hard to survive without it.\n2 Triskaidekophobia\n3 Mathematicians define a prime as a number with exactly two distinct positive divisors—1 and itself—thus excluding 1.\n4 In English.\n© 2025 All Rights Reserved.

He’d brought his family to New York in the late 1800s to carry on his father’s business as a pharmacist, but fate—or perhaps the city itself—seemed determined to drive him back out again. Lawall’s health had been in decline since their arrival, and his wife’s kidney disease had worsened, despite all of the tinctures and patent medicines available to his turn-of-the-century expertise. Not long after that, his business partner had been revealed as a crook, sending Lawall scrambling into bankruptcy court to convince the judge that his pharmacy had nothing to do with shady real estate dealings. Then, in the midst of the bankruptcy proceedings, an anonymous woman had staggered into Lawall’s drug store, collapsed on the floor, and died of unknown causes. Likely no one could have saved her, but it wasn’t exactly a ringing endorsement of the pharmaceutical services available at the corner of Eighth Street and Avenue C.\nNone of that compared, however, to the morning of 27 June 1906, when a disheveled man in a medical coat burst through the narrow glass doors of the pharmacy, begging for protection. He was immediately followed by a young man with a revolver, and an angry crowd screaming in Yiddish. Lawall didn’t speak the language, but there was no mistaking the young man’s intent as he strode purposely forward and raised his gun to the doctor’s head.\nIt was a grim, but recognizable tableau: the young man’s stance and grip were confident, clearly marking him as a budding gangster. The behavior of the crowd, on the other hand, made no sense at all. Innocent bystanders tended to run away from gang violence, yet the pushcart vendors and housewives surrounding the apparent holdup were not frightened, or even appealing for mercy. They were shouting, quite insistently, for the doctor’s execution. And everything seemed to indicate they were going to get what they wanted.\nIn the weeks that followed, blame would be pointed in nearly every direction—because at that moment, unbeknownst to Lawall, similar scenes were playing out all over the neighborhood, with other doctors, teachers, reporters, and even utility workers being assaulted by hordes of people howling at them in Yiddish. By the time it was over, the incident would be measured as one of the largest riots ever in New York City, and the confrontation at Lawall’s Pharmacy would be mentioned only in passing, if at all. Another name, however, would be repeated over and over again: Adeline E. Simpson, the principal of Public School No. 110.\nFor the toughest school in the city, P.S. 110’s architecture was surprisingly beautiful. Its five stories of white stone crowded the narrow sidewalk and ascended sharply upward, cutting through the street-level grime like a shaft of light. Where gargoyles would have traditionally stood, the roofline instead featured dozens of intricately carved owls—an homage to Florence Nightingale, who was famously fond of her pet owl, Athena, and who was technically the school’s namesake even if no one ever called it by anything but its number. Like the rest of the Lower East Side, the building’s pristine craftsmanship would soon be draped in a thick layer of grey soot, but in 1906, just three years after opening, it still stood as a proud testament to the Board of Education’s mission to prepare every child in New York City for a bright future, regardless of their background.\nIt didn’t take much, however, to recognize the façade for what it was. Behind the school’s decorative archways and wide, glass-paned windows sat roughly 2,400 children, all of whom lived within a one-block radius of the intersection at Broome and Cannon Streets. Any further, and they would have attended P.S. 92 instead, at Broome and Ridge, or P.S. 34 at Broome and Sheriff. “Some blocks seem to have a school on each of the four sides,” wrote a reporter for The Sun, and it wasn’t much of an exaggeration. Over at Hester and Essex, there were two schools immediately adjacent to one another, containing a total of more than 5,000 children under the age of 14, and Lawall’s Pharmacy itself was located between a pair of schools just 800 feet apart.\nAll told, there were about 565,000 registered school children in Manhattan in 1906, which, taking into account their adult relatives and the significant number of underaged dropouts, added up to as much as a quarter of a million people per square mile in some areas. (For comparison, in 2025, there were approximately 70,000 people per square mile living in Manhattan, though weekday commuters could push the density as high as 170,000.) Each September, school officials held their breath as they waited to find out how many young immigrants had arrived over the summer—and how badly their expansion estimates had been off. No one wanted a repeat of 1901, when they’d still had to turn away thousands of students for the year despite opening 11 new school buildings, filling some classes with as many as 60 children, and relegating hundreds in each campus to only a half-day of education each.\nThose who did secure a desk had no complaints about the crowding, as their homes were usually worse. Tenement apartments averaged just 325 square feet, and often contained up to a dozen people and zero plumbing. During the summer months, charitable water wagons would trundle the neighborhood offering simple hydration, and when the city installed swimming tanks in the schools for water safety training, those on the Lower East Side quickly repurposed them as bathtubs for students who had no other opportunity.\nThis was the world in which principal Adeline E. Simpson strove to make a difference in the lives of her students at Public School No. 110. She was a stout woman, with short, tightly curled hair and a thin mouth that seemed to frown and smile simultaneously—your best friend or your worst enemy, the choice was yours. Simpson was a school principal to her core, and she loved her job so much she did it twice: after working all day at P.S. 110, she would walk a mile and a half to the opposite side of the district and serve as the principal of the night school for adult women until 9:30 each night. A second job also offset the fact that state law capped her salary at $2,500, compared to $3,500 for male principals.\nUnlike the pharmacist Edmund Lawall, who existed at the frayed edges of the Lower East Side and perhaps had the luxury of feeling surprised by a gangster in his store, Simpson could look out her window and see one any time she liked. Directly across the street from P.S. 110 was a bird shop owned by the infamous “Monk” Eastman, which maintained a steady cash flow despite never selling a single bird. His relationship with violence was frighteningly casual: at one point, Eastman had begun shooting at the school for no reason other than target practice. As glass shattered and children screamed, Simpson marched across the street and lectured him the way only a school principal could. If Eastman didn’t care about dead children in general, she noted, he might at least care that his own children were inside the building. The lumpy, scarred gangster considered her for a moment, smoking weapon still in hand, then said, “You’re a good sport for not calling the cops.” He never troubled her again.\nYet Simpson was more than just a formidable authority. She cared deeply about her students and believed that every child had potential, an idea which was frankly laughable to many of her contemporaries. They’d tried to warn her, when she took the job, that P.S. 110 wasn’t just a bad school in a worse neighborhood. It had, over the years, been informally designated as a clearinghouse for what were known at the time as “backward” children; that is, children who suffered from cognitive, physical, or behavioral delays that left them unsuited to traditional education—and thus presumably destined for a life of crime and degeneracy. Of course, every school on the Lower East Side had struggling children on its roster, but at P.S. 110, there were at least 150 children in so-called “defectives classes,” who were three or more grades below what their ages would have indicated.\nIt only made her want the job more. Once she got there, in fact, Simpson actively encouraged her school’s status as the de facto junk bin, welcoming difficult students with open arms when no one else would. One such boy was Benjamin Apicello, who had been gathering firewood in the streets when he mistakenly picked up a “nice brown stick” that turned out to be a construction worker’s lost dynamite. The subsequent explosion in their kitchen had left Benjamin fully blind, and for five years his mother had been unable to find any school that would take him. When he finally enrolled at P.S. 110 at the age of 14, however, he wasn’t even the only blind student on campus—and in less than two years, Benjamin had caught up on his studies, graduated with honors, and was on his way to high school with the intention of becoming a lawyer.\nBut while Simpson’s individual victories could be impressive, her overall success rate remained sadly relative. Only around a third of her students made it to eighth-grade graduation, and of those, approximately 98 percent were girls. The gender gap was due, at least in part, to the parents: it was all too easy to give up on educating boys when menial labor seemed inevitable anyway. Officially, school was compulsory until age 14, but in reality, the “work certificate” program greased the wheels for would-be dropouts to exit the educational system. One boy who successfully applied for a work certificate at the Rochester Health Bureau was barely over 4 feet tall and weighed just 69 pounds. The evaluator admitted to being skeptical of his age—proven only by a handwritten baptismal record—but noted that his diminutive size could be explained by malnutrition. After all, he didn’t exactly look young. “Impressed upon his forehead were four distinct wrinkles, and at the corners of his small, red lidded eyes, crows’ feet were beginning to show.”\nUnfortunately, while anyone could recognize that poverty led to illness, far fewer at the time were aware that illness can also lead to poverty. Proper nutrition and medical treatment were generally considered a benefit of success, rather than a necessity for achieving it, and many disadvantaged workers, including parents, saw no point in treating small maladies. One doctor at the time recalled a woman who, when alerted to her son’s mouthful of rotting cavities, replied sourly, “He don’t work with his teeth.” Another ignored her son’s ear infections until the boy was nearly deaf, yet remained unable to see the connection between his physical health and his failing grades. Instead, she blamed the school, and began threatening to withdraw him entirely and “put him on a paper-stand to do real work.”\nSimpson, of course, did see the connection. Every single child in her defectives classes, she noted, suffered from one or more medical problems—and on the rare occasion that a parent did seek treatment, the child usually saw such improvement that they were promoted out of special education altogether. She was not completely alone in her observations: as far back as 1897, the New York Department of Health had employed a team of School Medical Inspectors to check for contagious outbreaks, and in 1901, they had expanded the program to include certified physicians who would screen the children for more general ailments. If any were discovered, a letter would be sent home to the parents encouraging them to visit a doctor, or else obtain free services at Mount Sinai Hospital if the family was unable to pay. But the letters were usually in English, and the few parents who could read them had oppressive work schedules that left no time for a 13-mile round trip to a hospital—especially when that facility offered none of the traditionally trusted remedies of their home countries. The cultural divide was so significant that many parents in the Lower East Side preferred to pay a neighborhood royfe (a fellow Russian-Jewish immigrant with some medical experience, but no formal training) rather than accept free treatment from the German-Jewish doctors of Mount Sinai, who were already Americanized by a generation or more. In the parents’ defense, the care was often comparable—penicillin was still more than 30 years away, and the effectiveness of handwashing in a medical setting would continue to be debated for another 60. But while the royfe was cheap, he wasn’t free, and this combined with all the other roadblocks to care meant that a significant number of immigrant children simply lived with their illnesses.\nSimpson, however, didn’t believe in giving up. If the parents couldn’t take their children to the doctor, then she would bring the doctor to the children. The Educational Board was already paying for medical exams, she argued, so why not pay for the prescriptions and procedures, too? The money would be easily recouped in preventative savings, since by some estimates a single repeated school year could cost taxpayers as much as $86 per student, while medical treatment might require as little as 50 cents.\nThe Chief Inspector for the Schools, Dr. John J. Cronin, was in favor of the idea. But if such an experiment were undertaken, he said, it would need to be dramatically effective, in order to serve as a model for other schools to do the same. Cronin understood the politics of city funding, and he knew that a piecemeal operation—bringing in one optometrist for a few pairs of glasses, then one dentist for a handful of cavities, and so on—would not provide the strong evidence he needed to convince the Board of Education. They had to choose one affliction that would bring about the most improvement for the most children in a single visit.\nThe answer, they decided, was swollen adenoids. According to medical understanding at the time, adenoids were “fungal growths” in the sinuses, just above and behind the uvula, which could cause a host of serious symptoms, including blocked airways, interrupted sleep, and even hearing loss. In reality, adenoids are a part of the lymphatic system that can become inflamed for several reasons, and surgically removing them remains a key treatment today just as it was in 1906. More to the point, this was the kind of advanced procedure that Lower East Side parents were less likely to commit to, yet which doctors knew from experience could bring about immediate improvement in a child who was previously too lethargic to concentrate. It was also a stunningly common problem, afflicting more than half of the students in Simpson’s severely delayed classrooms.\nWhile Cronin handled the medical arrangements, Simpson coordinated with the parents. Students were identified, permission slips were sent home, and while some came back with only a crude letter X on the signature line, all came back signed. On 21 June, just a week before classes were let out for the summer, Dr. Emil Meyer of Mount Sinai Hospital arrived at P.S. 110, along with eight nurses and eight physicians from the corps of medical inspectors. They paired off around chairs in an empty classroom, and as each child entered, Dr. Meyer swabbed their throat with an anesthetic which, given standard practice at the time, was almost certainly cocaine. The eight doctors worked so rapidly that each nurse barely had time to wipe the blood from her patient’s lips before the next one arrived, and in the end, they completed 83 operations in just 88 minutes. Then, for being such good sports, the children had an ice cream party.\nIt was, Simpson and Cronin agreed, an unqualified success. With a little healing, and three months of summer air flowing freely through their noses, one could only imagine how different these classrooms would look come September.\nSix days later, however, all Gehenna broke loose.\nIt started with just one man, a “strange” figure who raced through the tenements on the morning of 27 June, knocking on doors and telling parents that they must hurry to P.S. 110 and rescue their children. It’s unclear whether he gave an exact reason, but according to Simpson, at least 25 parents later reported that they had been visited, and the narrative quickly became that school officials were slitting children’s throats.\nTo Jewish immigrants in 1906, this was not a far-fetched accusation—most had come to America to escape persecution, and the ongoing pogroms in Russia had been particularly brutal. In these parents’ experience, local authorities did sometimes decide to murder every Jew in the city, and they often started with the children. Some reports would later claim that the adenoid surgeries had directly sparked the rumor, as children returned home “drooling mouthfuls of blood” and “barely able to speak” to parents who had never understood what they were signing off on. But that theory didn’t realistically fit the timeline, as a full six days had already passed without complaint. Instead, Simpson said, she was quite sure that the instigator was a disgruntled royfe who had learned about the operations, and did not appreciate having his business cut into by school officials. It wouldn’t be the first time they’d caused trouble, Simpson said—four years earlier, a group of parents had rushed to Gouverneur Hospital on the rumor that a field trip for eye exams was actually meant to blind them, and back then, “these low-class doctors openly complained to me that their practice was being interfered with by the city authorities.”\nBut while the Gouverneur Hospital incident had been relatively small, something this time was different. Perhaps the constant newspaper coverage of Jewish deaths in Kishinev and Bialystok was weighing on the parents’ minds. Perhaps the early summer heat had put them on edge. Perhaps many were skeptical, but decided that it was easy enough to go and confirm the truth when the school was only a few hundred feet away. Or perhaps, as some suggested, the spark was not a man knocking on doors, but a scathing editorial about the adenoid surgeries in a Yiddish-language newspaper—though this pre-riot editorial, if it existed, has not been subsequently found. Regardless of the initial cause, by 10:45 that morning, tens of thousands of concerned parents had swarmed not just P.S. 110, but every single school on the Lower East Side.\nLike the spread of a virus, most parents could point to another individual who had brought them into the fold. One of the earliest, according to The Sun, was “a hatless young Jewess with hair flying in the wind and the look of a mother tigress,” who reportedly ran across Broome Street toward P.S. 110 screaming, “The Christs are cutting my baby’s throat!” Others heard a different woman telling the crowd outside P.S. 110 that “they’ve killed four now and buried them in the cellar of the school.” A pushcart vendor five blocks away on Ludlow Street said that his sister-in-law had repeated the story to him, so he’d gone to his daughter’s school, P.S. 137, just “to see.” A plumber who had been working on Norfolk Street saw a handful of upset women outside P.S. 75, and initially approached to help calm them, but soon found himself smashing a length of lead pipe against the school doors and screaming, “Murderers!”\nEach escalation brought more in kind. One mother entered P.S. 34 and assaulted a teacher who tried to prevent her from “dragging her six-year-old daughter down three flights of stairs by the hair.” Others who had been locked out of their children’s schools began throwing rocks, vegetables, and anything else they could get their hands on. Leon King, a tailor on Stanton Street, fought off four police officers “as though they had been straws,” then “leaped a high railing and attacked a door with his finger-nails, feet, teeth and head.” According to the principal of P.S. 4, “One man tore his hair out. When I say this I am not speaking figuratively. He put both hands to his head, and when he held his hands out there was a bunch of hair in each one. For the moment he was raving mad.”\nThe police response was swift, but inadequate. According to The Evening World (whose staff writer subscribed to the Yiddish editorial theory,) a handful of officers were already inside P.S. 4 on Rivington Street before the crowds gathered, preemptively escorting the anxious medical inspectors on their typical rounds. Many of these physicians were Jewish, and if The Evening World is to be believed, they fully anticipated what would happen on the streets after reading such an inflammatory news item around their own breakfast tables. On the other hand, this same article features numerous verifiable errors, and a flair for dramatic narrative that was unfortunately average for newspapers at the time. Several medical inspectors were indeed on duty that morning—including one especially unlucky doctor who happened to be leaving P.S. 36, at Ninth Street and Avenue C, just half a block away from an otherwise unremarkable pharmacy—but none of them mentioned any pre-emptive action from the police. According to most sources, law enforcement was as blindsided as anyone.\nNonetheless, they put forth an admirable effort. Most of the Lower East Side was covered by the Thirteenth Precinct under Captain Patrick Byrne, whose 97-year-old station house was described in the 1905 Annual Report for the Police Department as “old, unsanitary and badly adapted for police purposes.” Within minutes of the first call, every officer and reserve patrol in Byrne’s command was responding to one of the four schools within a one-block radius of the station house, with no hope of reaching any further. Yet when Byrne called for backup from Captain Cooney, of the Union Market station, and Captain Murtha on Eldridge Street, he was informed that both were engaged with nearly a dozen schools of their own. If anything, they were worse off: Captain Cooney had been violently assaulted by several women outside P.S. 188, and the only person left to rescue him had been the station’s doorman.\nMeanwhile, Captain Murtha was engaged in a life-saving rescue of his own in front of Public School 20.\n“Fools, to send your children to American schools!” a man had scolded the crowd from his perch on the playground fence. “They butcher your babies right and left. I can give you the names of many children that have been killed and buried in the school cellars. I can give you the addresses of—”\n“Shut up,” yelled Detective Landers in Yiddish, “and come down out of there.”\n“This is a free country,” retorted 24-year-old David Stern, “and it is my right under the Constitution to—”\n“Constitution, hell!” said Landers, and grabbed Stern’s legs. Instantly, the crowd set upon him, pummeling Landers’ face and tearing off his clothes. For a moment it seemed as if his fellow officers would not be able to pull him free, but Landers was inspired by the realization that many in the crowd did not even know what they were protesting.\n“This is a thief—out of the way!” he shouted, and the crowd relaxed long enough for him to escape with his rabble-rouser in tow.\nBy 11:00 am, horse-mounted reserves had galloped in from every precinct in lower Manhattan. Mounted officers were considered as effective as ten men on foot, but even by that math, the total responding force for the roughly 50,000 rioters was less than 300 police. At P.S. 137, across the street from the Essex Market courthouse, there were no police available at all, and the court magistrate was forced to suspend proceedings so that bailiffs could go outside and attempt to quell the rioting parents. One of these parents was a jeweler named Otto Gottlieb, who had taken up a spot on the courthouse steps and was still shouting “They’re cutting their heads off!” as a court official wrestled him to the ground. Magistrate Breen fined him a dollar on the spot without trial. The District Attorney, meanwhile, tried to shoulder his way through the crowd toward the front of the school, where a woman had somehow acquired a ladder and was attempting to break through a second-story window.\nBy now, most schools had locked their doors against the commotion, and the anger of the mob turned toward any target it could find. A telephone lineman was brutally beaten after his tools were mistaken for surgical instruments, and a pair of reporters claimed that their eyeglasses branded them as potential doctors, resulting in a violent fusillade of fruit from vendors’ carts and exhortations to “Kill the cutthroats!”\nBut the worst accessory of all was a white doctor’s coat, which one unfortunate man was still wearing when he found himself inside Lawall’s Pharmacy with his hands in the air, surrounded by a screaming crowd who had paused their assault only because a young man with a revolver seemed poised to take care of the problem.\nIf Lawall had phoned the police, he would no doubt have received the same non-answer as every other call that morning. But by a miraculous stroke of luck, a single patrolman named Burke saw a crowd descending upon the pharmacy on the heels of a fleeing doctor. Burke forced his way in behind them, raising his own gun and demanding the teenage gangster’s surrender. To the relief of only a few, he complied. The boy would later be identified as Max Scott of 643 East Thirteenth Street, and he would be sentenced to a fine without jail time.\nMany others, however, were not yet safe, including the teachers inside the besieged schools. Some opened their doors, hoping that the parents would see their children were unharmed, and leave quietly. It didn’t work. “If a woman didn’t happen to find her child at once,” said principal Lizzie E. Rector of P.S. 4, “she set up a wail as if she had stumbled across its body.” Others went outside and attempted to address the crowd. “Your children are all right,” insisted principal Annie Boyne of P.S. 22. “I am a mother myself and will look out for your babies.” Rioters flung rocks at her in response. The district superintendent of schools, Julia Richman, took a firmer stance. When one well-dressed man tried to persuade her to sneak him past the locked doors, she told him that he should be ashamed of his foolishness. “I’m a Jewess myself, and I am sorry I have to talk this way to a man that speaks English as well as you do. You can see your child when school is dismissed.” He pushed past her, undeterred.\nOne by one, the principals realized that the safest—and realistically only—option was to cancel school for the day. But the subsequent flood of children into the streets only swelled the crowds and confusion. Some could not find their parents, while others had no interest in doing so, and a rush of several thousand children began loudly parading down Pitt Street, determined to enjoy their unexpected vacation. This, in turn, caused any parents still unaware of the commotion to hurry out of their tenements and join the fray.\nOne of the last schools to dismiss was P.S. 137, across from the courthouse, where the children had grown as dangerously panicked as the crowd outside. To open the doors between them now would surely result in someone getting trampled. Fortunately, several officers of the court had successfully made their way to the front of the school, and in a coordinated effort, they managed to force the line of parents back to the opposite side of Essex Street. On cue, principal Kate M. Stephens rang the gong signifying a fire drill, and in the brief pause that followed, a young teacher named Julia Hamburger began loudly singing the school song.\n“Three cheers for the red, white and blue! Three cheers for the red, white and blue! Oh, the Army and Navy forever—Three cheers for the red, white and blue!”\nStunned into relative complacency, the children began to fall into their standard routine, lining up behind her and singing along as she clapped out the beat with shaking hands. The scene was so unexpectedly bizarre that it worked: the crowd outside hesitated as the doors to the school were thrown open and the children marched out in formation, their clear voices evidence of their uncut throats.\n“It looked like pictures of the Crucifixion,” said Hamburger, who continued to solemnly guide them through the melee until each child had been recognized and snatched from the line with wails of relief. Once she was safely across the street, she sat down on the steps of the courthouse and wept.\nPrincipal Simpson, for her part, claimed that there was no riot at her school—or at least, that it was over as soon as it began. One of her first actions as principal had been to replace the old disciplinary system with a policy of student self-government, in which the children collectively determined their own “charter” through elected representatives, and rule-breakers were fully prosecuted and defended by classmates before an adolescent judge. It had taken several years for the cultural shift to take hold, but eventually the program became so successful that the children would even remonstrate with each other outside of school, such as when one student heard a classmate speaking rudely to his mother, and took the time to knock on his door and ask if that was “what you were taught in Public School 110.” On the day of the riot, Simpson said, the halls were being monitored by student leaders, as usual, so when the frantic parents arrived they were immediately calmed by the sight of self-assured children, who then escorted them to the appropriate classrooms without a fuss. She later told an interviewer that her school had not even needed to be dismissed, and most sources agree.\nIn the end, despite 50,000 rioters and countless acts of assault (not to mention 83 adenoidectomies of dubious consent), the fallout from the day’s violence included just three arrests, and zero deaths. By mid-afternoon, tempers had largely subsided, and while some schools chose to cancel that day’s graduation ceremonies, others managed to peacefully hold them in the evening. District superintendent Julia Richman made a personal appearance at P.S. 75 to chastise the parents.\n“The idea of believing that children were being killed and buried in cellars!” she marveled incredulously. The audience laughed, but she wasn’t having it. “Why didn’t you laugh this morning?” she demanded. “These rooms should be emptied of your children for a few months, and your silly mothers sent here for a term or two instead.”\nIt was an unfair generalization—the school Richman was standing in still bore the marks of a father’s lead plumbing pipe on the door—but in lieu of outright antisemitism, many tacitly agreed that it was safe to blame the women. “Crazed Women Storm Schools on East Side” read the headline for the Times Union the next day; “Women Rush to Schools” declared The Brooklyn Citizen. “Now that the region has reduced excitement to a science,” wrote a reporter for The Sun, “the woman-made panic is the best thing the East Side does.”\nOther papers, however, were not so dismissive. “A refugee generation can never quite overcome such alarm,” wrote The Buffalo Enquirer, “nor completely trust the faith of a new land.” A few even directly condemned Simpson’s experiment. “To go into a schoolhouse and remove adenoids wholesale,” said a reporter for The Standard Union, “is as absurd as it would be to go down the line pulling teeth, or performing the Lorenz operation for congenital hip disease.”\nTwo anonymous teachers, meanwhile, wrote to the editor of the New-York Tribune declaring that the real blame fell on journalists, whose “highly sensational accounts” of the riot had directly caused a smaller riot among Italian immigrant parents just one day later. (This, too, had been sensationalized by the same paper, only with swapped stereotypes: “Three schools… were mobbed by purple skirted, red ‘kerchiefed women. The janitor of one building was slightly stabbed by a stiletto in the hands of an infuriated mother, and several children were found to be characteristically armed with knives to repel the anticipated assaults of health doctors.”)\nBut despite the violence, indignation, and verbal sparring that continued well into the new year, Simpson regretted nothing. The students whose adenoids had been removed did, in fact, return in the fall showing major cognitive improvement, and both she and Chief Inspector Cronin assured the Board of Education that the riot had been an inevitable side effect of an otherwise incredibly successful operation. If anything, said Cronin, they should be happy that the bandage had been fully ripped off, because “after you have one good [riot], there are no more.”\nThis statement was demonstrably untrue, but many state officials nonetheless began to recognize the financial value in treating the ailments of the poor. Funding for the medical inspection program was significantly increased, on the condition that the money would go toward hiring more inspectors, rather than medical procedures. “We made that blunder once,” agreed Superintendent Richman, “and we will not do it again.”\nBy June of 1907, just one year after the riots, the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital had to make a public plea for more charitable funding, as “adenoid and tonsil operations performed in the hospital have greatly increased in number… and though it increases the expenses of the hospital, it is more than justified by the results.”\nSimpson never again received the same level of publicity as she did in the summer of 1906, but she continued to be praised in the papers every few years for various innovations, including teaching her eighth-graders how to sew their own graduation gowns in aspiration of high school, adding Latin to the curriculum at her night school for women, and overseeing one of the first racially integrated middle schools in the city. Her ongoing implementation of student self-government received several glowing profiles as well as a nod in a college textbook, and in 1933, she testified before the United States Senate on her experience in treating causes, rather than symptoms. “Medicine is progressively solving its problems by prevention of disease, instead of through cure,” she said. “[Degeneracy] requires most expert surgery for the eradication of its poisonous seeds.”\n© 2025 All Rights Reserved.

Remote and comparatively inhospitable, it was settled only as long ago as the 9th century, and has seen little additional in-migration since. Even today, more than 90 percent of Iceland’s 390,000 residents can trace their ancestry back to the earliest permanent inhabitants, a Nordic-Celtic mix. The tradition of the Norse sagas lives on in the form of careful record-keeping about ancestry—and a national passion for genealogy. In other words, it is not the place to stumble upon old family mysteries.\nBut growing up in the capital city of Reykjavík in the 1950s, neurologist Dr. Kári Stefánsson heard stories that left him curious. Stefánsson’s father had come from Djúpivogur, an eastern coastal town where everyone still spoke of a Black man who had moved there early in the 19th century. “Hans Jónatan”, they called him—a well-liked shopkeeper who had arrived on a ship, married a spirited woman from a local farm, and became a revered member of the community.\nThe local census did record a man by the name of Hans Jónatan, born in the Caribbean, who was working at the general store in Djúpivogur in the 19th century—but that was all. No images of the man had survived, and his time in Iceland was well before any other humans with African ancestry are known to have visited the island. If tiny, remote Djúpivogur did have a Black man arrive in the 19th century, the circumstances must have been unusual indeed.\nIt was an intriguing puzzle—and solid grounds for a scientific investigation. Given the amount of homogeneity in the baseline Icelandic population, the genetic signature of one relative newcomer with distinct ancestry might still stand out across a large sample of his descendants. Geneticists thus joined locals and history scholars, and they pieced together a story that bridged three continents.\nIn 1964, University of Copenhagen law professor Knud Waaben wrote an extensive review of two men born into slavery in the 18th century who ended up fighting for their rights in Danish court. History had lost track of both men, according to Waaben, and only speculation was possible as to any later stages in the life of either.\nOne of the two men had been born on 12 April 1784 in the town of Christiansted on the Caribbean island of St. Croix. This small piece of land—named by the French, intermittently occupied by the British, and technically owned by the Danish—exemplified the European-colonial squabbling that was playing out all over the Caribbean, not to mention the Americas and also the world in general.\nThe economies of St. Croix and the other Danish West Indies were driven almost exclusively by the Europeans’ relatively new but insatiable need for sugar. Production of the stuff was based on an incomprehensible amount of slave labour. Generations of field-slaves and house-slaves endured brutal conditions across hundreds of sugarcane plantations as European sugar magnates became enormously wealthy. By the late 18th century, St. Croix held around 3,000 white people—almost all men—plus about ten times as many Black slaves. Escape attempts were easily thwarted, since St. Croix afforded very few places to hide. Captured runaways were subjected to vicious beatings, public shaming, or both, even if they were children.\nIn Danish, he was called Hans Jonathan, as he was born into slavery and thus not entitled to a surname. His mother was a house slave named Regina, who at the time was in her mid-20s; her pregnancy was likely involuntary. Regina’s owner was a wealthy young widow named Henrietta Cathrina Schäffer, who brought with her Regina and several other slaves when she married Ludvig Heinrich Ernst von Schimmelmann, a local judge from a prominent German-Danish family who was rapidly climbing through the political ranks of the Danish West Indies. In 1784, the same year Hans Jonathan was born, Schimmelmann was appointed Governor-General of the territory.\nHans was noticeably lighter-skinned than his mother, which suggested he was the offspring of Regina and a free white man. Exactly which free white man is unknown; historical records are vague, indicating only that the father in question was “said to be the secretary”. In his extensive 2014 biography of Hans Jonathan, Icelandic anthropologist Gísli Pálsson weighs the evidence and considers several possibilities. He points out that if “the secretary” is taken literally, the most logical match is a man named Hans Gram, who was the Schimmelmanns’ scribe at the time (though Gram would later find minor fame in the United States as a composer). That said, “the secretary” is not a reliable clue, as it may have been either someone’s guess or a deliberate cover story. Other candidates for Hans’ paternity cannot be ruled out—including Schimmelmann himself.\nLittle Hans spent his early childhood at the Schimmelmanns’ sugar plantation, Constitution Hill, picking up three languages used locally (Danish, English, and the St. Croix creole of the time). In 1788, Schimmelmann left his post in the Danish West Indies, and he and Henrietta made arrangements to return to Copenhagen and settle in an affluent neighbourhood. They selected several adult slaves to take back to the homeland—including Hans’s mother, now called Emilia Regina after a mandatory baptism in 1787, and her brother. The slave children were another matter. They were considered too young to bother with, so four-year-old Hans, along with his younger half-sister and their two cousins, were left behind in Christiansted. Surprisingly, four years later, the Schimmelmanns appear to have changed their minds; they arranged for the two eight-year-olds—Hans and one of his cousins—to travel to Copenhagen and join the household in 1792.\nEurope was another world relative to St. Croix, and not just because it was colder. The languages were mostly familiar, but the capital of Denmark was large, bustling, and cosmopolitan—home to almost 100,000 people from a variety of backgrounds. Far removed from the sugar plantation, here all of the slaves were house-slaves; they were responsible for looking after the Schimmelmanns’ children, and cleaning and maintaining the family’s lavish five-storey mansion to the standards of European aristocrats.\nLudvig Schimmelmann died at the end of 1793; most of his surviving children moved out in their young adulthood before the end of the century. Now the head of household, Henrietta Schimmelmann made it very evident that she believed in the traditional definition of slavery, whereby her slaves would do her bidding and that was that. The Copenhagen census of 1801 lists that she had nine “servants” at the time, including Hans, his mother, and his cousin. Hans was given a small amount of schooling—enough to learn to read and write and do arithmetic, which suited Hans’s curiosity and intellect. Alongside this, he received exposure to European music and fell in love with playing the violin. At some point, he was able to acquire an instrument of his own, which he cherished. Once he was a teenager, he was to some extent allowed to roam the city on his own. Still, he and the few other Black house-slaves of Copenhagen did not have true freedom, nor would it have readily occurred to their owners to consider giving it to them.\nMore broadly, across Europe slavery was becoming a contentious political issue. Abolitionist thought was on the rise, with an increasing number of people scoffing at defenders’ insistence that slaves were happy (or, if unhappy, it was their own fault). Denmark agreed in 1792 that it would soon put a stop to new slave trading; however, this would not end any pre-existing slavery. In order to mitigate the inconvenience to angry wealthy white people, the changes would take effect only in stages over several years. In 1795, it became illegal for Danish slaveholders to transport Caribbean slaves back to Denmark (as the Schimmelmanns had done). In 1803, slave trading beyond the Danish West Indies was outlawed.\nBut none of this freed Hans Jonathan. As the 18th century turned into the 19th, he found himself in a rotten state indeed, and started pushing back against his lot in life. He repeatedly broke his evening curfew, spending time in the city and mingling with locals, visitors, and students studying in Copenhagen. This infuriated Henrietta. She would stay up waiting for him, then lecture him when he finally returned. Henrietta was a well-off, powerful woman with allies throughout the upper ranks of Danish society. She had no trouble putting her foot down to rein in a disobedient teenage slave.\nThings reached their breaking-point at the beginning of 1801 when greater hostilities flared and Denmark found itself on the brink of war with the United Kingdom. Normally these two countries got along with each other, but that was mainly because Denmark tended to be wary and deferential. The British as a colonial and trading power were brash, dominant, heavy-handed, and hypercompetitive. They were especially interested in keeping war supplies out of the hands of their most dependable adversaries—the French. So when Denmark sought to enter into an alliance with Russia, Sweden, and Prussia to facilitate trade with France, it flung British hackles into the stratosphere. Enraged, Great Britain intercepted a group of Danish trading ships, setting the scene for direct naval conflict. Up against the most powerful navy on the planet, Denmark put out a call for patriotic men to enlist.\nHenrietta Schimmelmann’s 20-year-old son enthusiastically took up the call and went to serve in the Royal Danish Navy. Right behind him was a similarly eager 16-year-old Hans Jonathan—until Henrietta caught him and said absolutely not. Hans argued that he did not have to follow her rules. Appalled, Henrietta reached for a cane and whacked the young man with it several times to show him who was boss. That did it. Later that evening, Hans said a quick goodbye to his mother, then walked off the Schimmelmann property and joined the Navy anyway.\nHenrietta went to the police. Her son had spoken to them just two days prior, reporting the disappearance of money from his possession—200 Danish rigsdalers (several thousand dollars in modern USD). There is no evidence that this had anything to do with Hans Jonathan, but Henrietta decided to blame her slave for it anyway—on top of complaining about his running away. This move was a gamble that could soon have turned very dark, as theft in Denmark had frequently been treated as a capital offense. Henrietta emphasised that the punishment she sought was merely to have Hans Jonathan sent back to St. Croix and sold. That would put him in his place—literally and otherwise.\nMeanwhile, the newly minted naval recruit was about to help his current country face the British. It was the beginning of April, and Britain was eager to catch Danish ships in port at Copenhagen as early as possible. Any later in the spring, and the ice would melt enough to risk letting the Russians out to assist Denmark. In Copenhagen, the Danes would have the home-field advantage, but that was all that could be said for them, as their fleet was much smaller than the British Royal Navy and not remotely as well-trained.\nThe Danish people tended to be quiet about their devotion to their country, but when the Battle of Copenhagen began on 2 April 1801, Denmark found itself whipped into a fiery patriotic frenzy. Hans Jonathan was assigned to the Charlotte Amalie, a ship named after a queen consort from a century earlier. The ship took the not-quite-17-year-old and his shipmates straight to the heart of the action. Barely 300 metres from two huge British ships, the Charlotte Amalie exchanged fire with the British over the course of a harrowing four hours, as the doctors below the deck of the ship desperately tried to keep up with the number of men being wounded or worse. The Danish navy did get a boost from Copenhagen’s narrow harbour, which was difficult for the large British vessels to navigate; Britain briefly wavered and considered retreating, but then regained the upper hand. With British victory inevitable, British Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson sent a letter to Danish Crown Prince Frederick proposing a ceasefire—the acceptance of which, he added, would keep him from having to set fire to the captured Danish ships with the crews still inside. Frederick accepted, ending the Battle of Copenhagen and kick-starting negotiations between the two countries.\nThe Charlotte Amalie was battered and had lost about one-sixth of its men. But Hans Jonathan was uninjured, plus his captain noticed his resolve and praised him specifically in front of others. On top of that, the Navy paid the young man 15 Danish rigsdalers for his service in battle (between $200 and $300 in modern USD).\nHans Jonathan probably thought that in joining the Navy against Henrietta Schimmelmann’s wishes, he had made his point. After all, he had risked his life—and perhaps secured a future for himself as a Danish naval officer instead of a slave. It had been only days since the Battle of Copenhagen, but, assuming that Henrietta had given up, Hans went home to see his mother.\nHenrietta had done no such thing. The police had paid little attention to her complaint—the imminent British threat to the city had been somewhat more pressing. Without reinforcement, Henrietta created a makeshift jail by locking Hans inside the Schimmelmanns’ property. But after a couple of days she decided that she’d had enough, and released him back to the Royal Danish Navy.\nThe Navy briefly assigned Hans to a ship called the Denmark, where he forthrightly shared his unusual story with Captain Steen Andersen Bille. Subsequently, reassigned to the Elephant, Hans met a man much like himself: a slave named Peter Samuel who had also just served in the Battle of Copenhagen. Unlike Hans, Peter was in the Navy at the insistence of his owner. Still, the men had a shared goal in securing their freedom. Fortunately, they had an influential ally in Hans’s previous captain. Bille was a thoughtful man who had spent time in the Danish West Indies and was sympathetic to the two men’s cause. Better yet, he was so well-respected in the Danish government that he could simply take the issue directly to Crown Prince Frederick—which he did.\nAs biographer Pálsson points out, this was a dilemma for Frederick, who knew both Steen Bille and Henrietta Schimmelmann well, and was now caught between them in a dispute. Taking either position on the issue of the promising young naval recruit who was also a runaway slave could have amounted to a betrayal.\nFrederick considered. Possibly in the spirit of Europe’s encroaching doubt about slavery, he ended up writing a very cautiously worded, three-page letter to Bille on 12 May 1801, gently arguing that on homeland Danish soil, the only people who could be convincingly argued to be legally slaves were prisoners whose sentences specified servitude. As long as Henrietta Schimmelmann was located within Denmark proper, he continued, no one in her household could qualify as anything lower than a free servant. While the letter did not name Hans Jonathan specifically as the person who “is considered free and enjoys rights”, it did refer to Henrietta Schimmelmann, so the intended referent was unambiguous.\nIt was more than enough for Captain Steen Bille. On 14 May, Bille officially bestowed freedom on Hans Jonathan. From a different commanding officer, but as the result of the same letter from Crown Prince Frederick, his shipmate Peter Samuel received the same. Finally free at 17, Hans Jonathan rented a room above a tavern, filled it with his possessions including the beloved violin, and began to consider how to pursue the life of his own that he had sought for so long.\nThe development left Henrietta Schimmelmann newly irate. Only a handful of people had seen Frederick’s letter to Bille, and it is not clear if Henrietta was among them; either way, the consequences would have allowed her to infer a major risk to her ability to maintain her household the way she wanted it. The letter was, from this perspective, a dangerous precedent. On its basis, any of the other eight slaves in her household (including Hans Jonathan’s mother, uncle, and cousin) could simply walk away with the presumed blessing of Denmark’s very ruler. Unacceptable! On 19 May—only a week after the release of Frederick’s letter—Henrietta marched straight back into the same police station as before and submitted a formal written complaint, asking the authorities to arrest and question Hans Jonathan.\nThis time, the police officers went out looking for Hans. Finding him at the tavern, they explained the issue. Hans told them he wanted to serve the Danish monarch by remaining in the navy—and he told the police that he would provide evidence of having been set free.\nThe complaint was left to be resolved by the courts, but when the case came up in front of the judges, Henrietta Schimmelmann was not in attendance. She had vowed to send relevant documents via her intermediary—her steward Peder Hansen—but when Hansen arrived, he claimed to have no documents to show. The court threw out the case, and Hans Jonathan was free once again. But Henrietta had not given up. She went to the navy and requested 400 rigsdalers as compensation for losing her slave (somewhere between $5,000 and $7,000 in modern USD). The Navy brushed her off.\nA badly timed coincidence gave her a new idea. On 20 July 1801, a slave named David Tams slipped away from his rural Danish household and made a wild dash for Copenhagen. He too was from St. Croix and had been brought back to the homeland by slaveowners. However, his attempt at entering the city got him arrested. Tams’s irritated owner then opened a civil lawsuit hoping to establish a legal claim on the man—and Henrietta Schimmelmann, bringing a whole new meaning to the term “follow suit,” decided to do the same. Legally, this was much less complicated than her earlier accusations of theft and desertion; if she won the civil case, it would simply establish that she owned Hans Jonathan, end of story.\nIt was not obvious how this new court case would go. On the one hand, bringing slaves from the Danish West Indies to Denmark itself had been technically illegal since 1795. On the other, Hans Jonathan had arrived in Denmark before that point, and his move to Copenhagen had not automatically voided his status as a slave. If Henrietta owned him, she should still have the right to sell him. With that, on the evening of 3 December 1801, four police officers set off for the tavern to arrest Hans Jonathan—who once again explained the existence of the letter from Crown Prince Frederick to Captain Steen Bille ensuring his freedom. The police officers were unmoved. A slave with a personal letter from the Crown Prince of Denmark? Suuuure. Within an hour, Hans was in a cell.\nAt the time, Danish courtroom processes were conducted slowly and mainly through written statements. However, then, as now, access to skilled legal assistance was not equitable. Henrietta Schimmelmann, wealthy and connected, had a steadfast lawyer named N. C. Bierring, and he did so much of the work that there is no evidence she ever made an appearance in court herself. At the other end of the scale, Hans Jonathan was unable to afford the services of any lawyer, and was assigned an attorney by the court, a man thought to be named ‘Beyer’ (though sources do not agree).\nBierring slammed Hans Jonathan for his (supposed) shameless lying—to think that a slave could have had the backing of the Danish crown prince! Captain Bille still had the copy of the letter from Crown Prince Frederick, and either way could have established the truth if called as a witness. However, for some reason, Beyer did not call Bille, which suggests some incompetence as it left the accusation of lying unchallenged. Beyer also made a few errors in recounting the facts of the case, and at one point lapsed into sarcasm. Bierring leapt at the chance to criticise Beyer’s tone, undercutting the inconvenient fact that some of Beyer’s arguments had merit and strength. For instance, Beyer had been through the Danish legal code and found absolutely no support for slavery in homeland Denmark. Also, had Henrietta Schimmelmann not said in her written statement to police that Hans Jonathan had “left her service”—and thus never been anything less than a servant?\nEvery single one of the witnesses was from Henrietta Schimmelmann’s household, and meant to support the plaintiff. However, they were less than cooperative. Emilia Regina was understandably unhelpful when it came to answering questions in a case against her own son (especially with her own freedom possibly being at stake as well). Likewise, Henrietta’s steward Peder Hansen stood up for Hans Jonathan and pointed out that Henrietta had physically beaten him “a few times with a Spanish stick” and that Hans had left in order to serve his country. Beyer also asked: who was the young man’s father, anyway? A “free white man” or a slave? Presumably the idea was to explore the possibility that Henrietta Schimmelmann’s claim on Hans Jonathan was far from watertight—but the judges accepted Bierring’s objection of “irrelevant” and refused to let Emilia Regina respond.\nToward the end of May 1802, the analogous case of David Tams wrapped up—Danish judges sided with the man’s owner. For Hans Jonathan only days later, the judges likewise announced on 31 May their decision that Hans Jonathan was Henrietta Schimmelmann’s property and she was legally permitted to send him back to the Danish West Indies to be sold. Four of the judges saw no room for argument. The fifth, a young man not much older than Hans himself, ended up siding with his seniors but also made room in his comments for a dissenting argument that Caribbean slaves arriving on Danish soil could only be servants rather than slaves—precisely the conclusion that Crown Prince Frederick had drawn in his not-at-all-fictional letter.\nThe courts had not found Hans guilty of any crime, but unless he chose to appeal the verdict, he was required to turn himself in to Henrietta Schimmelmann within 15 days. The court does not seem to have noticed that, as a strategy for containing a runaway, this plan left something to be desired.\nIn the days following the verdict, a summary of the case and its outcome were published and disseminated as usual to the people of Copenhagen—thus making very public the dispute between the socialite and the escaped slave. One Danish government official even wrote to the Danish West Indies to warn them that an ill-behaved man named Hans Jonathan might soon be sold on the island. For the social elite, the details of the civil lawsuit made for irresistible gossip, to the point that it may have become a problem for Henrietta Schimmelmann in spite of her nominal victory.\nHans Jonathan did not request an appeal. He also did not surrender himself to Henrietta Schimmelmann. He was nowhere to be found. Once the 15-day period had elapsed, Henrietta gained the legal right to have him located and arrested. However, she does not seem to have requested police assistance. Instead, within only a year, she moved her household out of the city altogether.\nHowever one-sided, the case was enough of a landmark that the story of the young biracial Black man up against a crushing system remains fairly well-known in Danish legal circles. But the man himself had apparently walked out of the courtroom and into the streets of Copenhagen and vanished. Even more than 150 years later, a comprehensive 1964 article by Danish law professor Knud Waaben would point out that historians had no idea what had become of David Tams and Hans Jonathan.\nAround 2003, a handful of Icelanders found the 1964 Knud Waaben article. One of them reached out to Waaben, suggesting the possibility that Hans Jónatan—the Caribbean-born ancestor who had arrived in Djúpivogur with the Danish trading ships—was the same Hans Jonathan who had faced the punitive Danish legal system only very slightly earlier. All of the pieces fit, and Hans Jónatan’s backstory filled in the missing history.\nShortly after the 1802 verdict was read, Hans Jonathan briefly and surreptitiously stopped by Henrietta Schimmelmann’s house to gather his possessions, including the treasured violin, and say goodbye to his mother.\nAt the time, the Danish empire included both Norway and Iceland. While Norway was a powerhouse on the level of Denmark itself, Iceland was heavily agrarian and deep in the clutches of its colonial overlords. In 1800, the island’s 50,000 people were split between so many individual farms and tiny rural towns that even the largest settlement, Reykjavík, had a population of no more than 300. While Iceland had its own history, its own language, and its own literary tradition, Denmark had it in a stranglehold. The Danish essentially maintained a monopoly on trade with Iceland, forbidding the locals from trading with anyone else, and often treated the island like a pesky dependent child.\nIt was around the end of June 1802—just after the northern ice had melted for the summer—that one of the usual Danish trade-ships docked at the town of Djúpivogur along the eastern fjords of Iceland and Hans Jonathan stepped off. The journey had taken about two weeks. It is not known whether Hans chose this location specifically, or simply decided to leave Copenhagen for any reasonably far-flung destination as soon as he could. It is also unclear whether he intended to stay in Djúpivogur or to keep moving around as needed. Perhaps, in the manner of a talented musician, he played it by ear.\nAt least he could ask around for opportunities at his destination right away. Djúpivogur, population approximately 100, had sprung up as a trading post, and as a result a number of the locals spoke Danish as well as Icelandic.\nNone of them would have been at all familiar with the sight of a Black man, even a light-skinned biracial Black man. Fortunately, the locals welcomed him without xenophobia. They likely thought of him as the sort of Danish man they were familiar with: a merchant. Which, in fact, is what he soon became. Almost immediately following his arrival in Djúpivogur, Hans met the manager of the town’s general store, Jón Stefánsson, and was hired as an assistant.\nStefánsson was known for his kindness towards Djúpivogur’s townspeople and its very few visitors. He was a businessman but also a songwriter of local renown, not to mention an enthusiastic collector and lender of books. To Hans, Stefánsson soon proved to be a key mentor and a close friend. Stefánsson was Icelandic, but he spoke Danish as well; his wife was also from Denmark.\nIcelandic census records accurately list Hans Jonathan’s name, profession, and birthplace—suggesting that he was honest about his origins and background, perhaps due to having quickly established trust with the people of Djúpivogur. However, he must have weighed the risks while deciding what to tell his new neighbours. With so many Danes around, word could conceivably have reached the relentless Henrietta Schimmelmann. On the other hand, especially once he became a trained businessman, Hans may also have been aware that the costs of retrieving an errant slave from so far away would not have been profitable. Besides, by 1807, Denmark was busy contending with a resurgent United Kingdom, leading to a Second Battle of Copenhagen and its humiliating aftermath (including British occupation of the Danish West Indies). A missing slave was not high on anyone’s priority list.\nBy 1809, on a sparsely populated island where the Atlantic slave-trade was not likely to be on many people’s radar, Jón Stefánsson translated fiery abolitionist essays from Danish into Icelandic. It is probable that this project sprang from discussions that Stefansson was having with his assistant.\nHans had found a niche for himself in every respect. As a young assistant storekeeper, he gained a reputation as a stellar record-keeper, committed to both accuracy and integrity. Some of his records from the Djúpivogur store survive, in tidy Danish-style handwriting. The local oral history preserved tales of Hans Jonathan’s insistence on rectifying accounting errors regardless of who was in the wrong. He gave generously of his time, sharing practical skills related to everything from mathematics to construction to wayfinding. Another of his routine duties was helping visitors to Djúpivogur navigate the harsh local terrain. A Norwegian surveyor, a Scottish preacher, and a Danish friend of the Stefánssons’ all ended up mentioning Hans Jonathan by name in their memoirs.\nHe was never a wealthy man in Iceland—never a landowner, in a place where virtually everyone else was. But he had his freedom and enough to live on, and he consistently spoke up for the rights and wellbeing of those less fortunate. It is uncertain whether he learned in 1816 that Henrietta Schimmelmann had died. Back in Denmark, he may have been close enough to her children to infer that they did not share their mother’s keen interest in owning slaves. At any rate, from that point onwards, no one would be chasing Hans Jonathan with a metaphorical net.\nA few years later, the storekeeper Jón Stefánsson contracted a serious illness, and died in 1819. A Danish mercantile company bought the store and put 35-year-old Hans Jonathan in charge. Around the same time, romantic sparks developed: he and a 21-year-old woman named Katrín Antoníusdóttir caught each other’s attention. She came from a farming family based near Djúpivogur, and was a hard-working, skilled, well-liked member of the community. On 28 February 1820, they were married in a local church; the catering was provided by Jón Stefánsson’s widow Ellen Katrín.\nTo this day, the general practice in Iceland is for children’s second names to be based on the first name of one of the parents; nearly everyone is ‘son of X’, ‘daughter of Y’, or ‘child of Z’. In other words, it did not matter that Hans Jonathan had never had a mainland-European-style family surname in the first place. However, he and his wife decided to treat Hans’s second name like a surname anyway, and to pass it along to their children. Ludvik Stefan Jonathan was born on 26 May 1821, and Hansina Regina Jonathan followed on 4 August 1824.\nIn between the arrivals of the children, however, the store at Djúpivogur ran into financial trouble. Hans could not stand the sight of poverty and ended up putting the store in debt in order to assist the locals who were struggling the most. In 1823, he left his job and moved his family to a rental farm. This was a small and undistinguished property, but the couple’s combined skills—Katrín having grown up on a farm twice the size—allowed them to carve out a life there. Records of the family’s possessions attest to music-making, ice-skating, and book-reading alongside everyday farmwork.\nBut Hans’s former employer remained suspicious of him. In 1827, the new store managers concluded that some grain was missing from storage, and asked whether he knew anything about this. The issue never received a resolution. While out in the fields, 43-year-old Hans Jonathan died suddenly of what was probably a cerebral hemorrhage. Given that his family was only renting the farm at Borgargarður, Katrín had him buried at her own family’s farm in nearby Hals. However, as headstones were very expensive, the exact location of his grave is not known.\nMany of Hans’s assets were liquidated to settle the outstanding debts—though his beloved violin went to his son Ludvik. Katrín likely continued running the farm at Borgargarður and raising the children on her own, at least until she remarried in about 1834 and the family moved to the town of Bulandnes several years later. Ludvik and Hansina both married and started families of their own, but then both died in their 30s. Fortunately, Katrín lived until 1869, which was long enough to finish raising her six surviving grandchildren and see them all become locally well-respected young adults.\nSlavery was finally abolished in the Danish West Indies in 1848, though the system of bound servitude that replaced it was not much better. Only the decline of the sugarcane industry finally brought it all crashing down. In 1917, with the plantation era behind and the colony becoming a financial burden, Denmark sold the Danish West Indies to the United States, which paid $25 million and renamed the territory the U.S. Virgin Islands. Its capital on the island of St. Thomas is still named Charlotte Amalie. As for Iceland, it finally gained full independence from Denmark in 1944, and Reykjavík has become a city of more than 100,000 people.\nOver a century later, in the 1990s, Dr. Kári Stefánsson did not set out to investigate Hans Jónatan’s genetic history. Instead, he became a neurologist, and moved to the United States to complete his training at the University of Chicago, then on to Harvard University to teach. But Stefánsson found himself repeatedly thinking of the untapped scientific potential of mapping and studying the gene pool in his home country.\nStefánsson realised that Iceland’s genetic homogeneity could make it a spectacular natural laboratory. While the combination of a small founding population and a low number of newcomers would not eliminate random mutations in the genome over time, it would certainly control for genetic variance between humans to an unusual degree. One of Stefánsson’s earliest ideas along these lines, for instance, proposed comparing the genetic material of Icelanders with and without multiple sclerosis (MS). Given extremely similar ancestry, the DNA of these two groups would be overwhelmingly comparable. If such a study identified a tiny number of systematic differences between the individuals with MS and those without, those differences would be candidates for the genetic origins of MS in humans more generally. The study would be all the better for taking place in a country with universal health care and—characteristically—extensive medical record-keeping.\nBy 1996, the chance to launch an enormous Icelandic genome project was too tempting to pass up. Stefánsson resigned his position as Chief of Neuropathology at Harvard and moved back to Iceland to establish deCODE Genetics. While deCODE was always a private biopharmaceutical company, and there are privacy concerns in the collection of health-related information, many Icelanders have been willing to provide consent. The number represented in the data held by deCODE is now well above two-thirds of the adult population of the country—and the findings have been unlike anything else in the world. Aside from identifying markers of susceptibility to particular genetic diseases, the findings have yielded high-resolution models of the human genome, inspired new drug development, and illuminated several aspects of how genes recombine in human offspring.\nIn the last decade, with new scholarly attention from multiple angles, the full story of Hans Jonathan finally came together. University of Iceland history professor Gísli Pálsson published a full biography of Hans in Icelandic in 2014, with an English translation by Anna Yates (The Man Who Stole Himself) following in 2016.\nMeanwhile, deCODE undertook another milestone. Remembering the stories of his youth about the Black ancestor in his father’s hometown of Djúpivogur, Stefánsson started a project with several colleagues to reassemble the man’s genome from the genetic information in his descendants alone. What made the task straightforward was that the signal of any recent African ancestry would be clear against the backdrop of the limited Nordic/Celtic gene pool that had characterised Iceland for 1,200 years. In their 2018 paper, the researchers verified that the only noticeable source of recent African DNA in the Icelandic gene-pool in the fifty years between 1880 and 1930 had come from only one individual with XY sex chromosomes: Hans Jónatan. His Y chromosome, inherited from his father, was typical of mainland Europe; his X chromosome, from his mother, was clearly African in origin.\nA number of Hans Jonathan and Katrín Antoníusdóttir’s descendants have been noted musicians, and great-granddaughter Hansína Regína Björnsdóttir was a well-known early photographer in the late 19th century. By the 2010s, the genetic researchers who collaborated on the 2018 paper—17 geneticists including Kári Stefánsson himself—found 788 verified living descendants. They partially sequenced the genomes of 182 of these descendants, then for 20 of those, the researchers sequenced their genomes in their entirety. While no single descendant could have inherited all or even most of Hans Jonathan’s DNA, different descendants got different pieces and combinations, and with the influence of the baseline Icelandic gene-pool (i.e. Katrín) filtered out, Hans’s genes from elsewhere have been revealed. While the identity of Hans Jonathan’s “free white man” father has not yet been determined, the researchers have found considerable insight in an analysis of Hans’s maternal DNA.\nWe know very little about Emilia Regina’s background from the historical record alone. Emilia Regina appears to have been born around 1760, possibly the daughter of one of three house-slaves at a sugar plantation called “La Reine”, but it is not even clear whether she was born on St. Croix or transported there from Africa at a young age. After Henrietta Schimmelmann’s 1802 civil lawsuit, Emilia Regina disappears from the record entirely.\nIn 2017, Denmark issued a formal apology for the role it played in the European slave-trade. Modern genetics cannot possibly compensate for the harm done, but it can offer some answers after-the-fact and help descendants and their supporters put some of the pieces back together.\nThe researchers on the 2018 paper zeroed in on Hans Jonathan’s maternal haploid genome—his DNA from Emilia Regina—and reported having been able to reassemble about 38 percent of it. This is a stunning amount of information gathered from modern descendants alone about the mother of a man who died in 1827. Comparing the DNA to reference populations from different parts of the African continent, the geneticists found that Emilia Regina was clearly linked with present-day populations of Nigeria, Cameroon, and Benin—particularly those of Yoruba descent. In reverse-engineering the DNA of a group of present-day descendants to make new discoveries about ancestors from centuries ago, this case study is the first of its kind.\nTo be sure, the unusual circumstances of Hans Jonathan’s background, in conjunction with his excellent choice of hiding place and the large number of descendants he has, all ensured that this was a relatively clear-cut demonstration of how the DNA of a single ancestor could be disentangled from everything else going on in a population’s collective genes. Still, it is a leap forward for human understanding. Centuries ago, slaves in the Americas abducted from Africa frequently hoped that they would be able to someday return. On the individual level, extremely few were able to do so; however, genetic genealogy opens up the possibility of making reconnections to bridge the gaping hole.\nAs the editors of Nature Genetics commented in a short editorial accompanying the release of the 2018 article on the background of Hans Jonathan, the project crucially involves “our interwoven genomic and social histories.” In other words, DNA is something of a time-capsule of all of our biological ancestors. To the extent that we are our genes, we are also the histories of those who came before us – just as our own histories will be interwoven with those to come.\n© 2024 All Rights Reserved.

          "content": "How Do Menopause and a Treatment to Manage Its Symptoms Affect the Brain and Mental Health?\nNew research suggests an association between menopause and anxiety, depression and shrinkage in certain brain regions—which hormone replacement therapy might not mitigate\nWhen a person stops menstruating, typically around age 45 to 55, they might endure hot flashes, mood swings and sleep issues. Someone going through menopause can also experience cognitive decline, finding it hard to concentrate or remember things, for example.\nTo treat such symptoms, some people use hormone replacement therapy (HRT). It supplies them with additional estrogen, a sex hormone that the body makes less of after menopause. But how this treatment, as well as menopause, affects the brain and mental health has remained unclear.\nA new analysis involving nearly 125,000 participants hints at an association between menopause and certain sleep and mental health problems, in addition to shrinkage in specific brain regions. What’s more, HRT may not mitigate these effects, although it might slow some aspects of cognitive decline, according to a study published January 27 in the journal Psychological Medicine.\n“To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of menopause and HRT on mental health, cognition and brain structure in a very large sample of women,” the study authors write in the paper.\nThe researchers relied on data from the UK Biobank, a cohort study with roughly half a million participants from the United Kingdom who were recruited from 2006 to 2010. For the new analysis, they included information from female participants who were pre-menopausal, post-menopausal and had taken HRT or post-menopausal and hadn’t used the medication. A subset of them, about 11,000 individuals, also had brain scan data.\nDid you know? Menopause is a rarity among animals\nHumans, chimpanzees and some whale species are among the few mammals known to live beyond their female reproductive ages and go through menopause.\nThe participants’ self-reported questionnaires revealed more depression and anxiety, as well as poorer sleep, in post-menopausal individuals compared with those who were pre-menopausal. People who were no longer menstruating also showed decreased volumes of gray matter, a tissue comprised of nerve cell bodies that helps with mental functions, in certain brain regions important for emotion and memory.\nPost-menopausal participants who had taken HRT showed worse sleep and mental health symptoms and more brain region shrinkage than those who hadn’t used the treatment, the team found. Neither the therapy nor menopause affected cognitive measures of memory.\nStill, HRT-takers did seem to gain one cognitive benefit. Their reaction times, assessed through a fast-paced card-matching game, were quicker than those of post-menopausal participants who didn’t use the treatment—and were on par with those of individuals still menstruating. (Reaction times tend to slow with age.)\nBut the researchers don’t know which HRTs or doses the participants received, Roberta Brinton, a neuroscientist at the University of Arizona Health Sciences who was not involved with the study, tells Scientific American’s Jackie Flynn Mogensen. “The type of and treatment regimen of menopausal hormone therapy is a critical factor in the efficacy, or lack thereof, for neurological [and] brain-related functions.”\nStudy co-author Barbara Sahakian, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, acknowledges the critiques. “But I think the basic findings still hold, independent of that,” she tells the outlet.\nAdditionally, the study authors note that their analysis suggests that participants who used HRT possibly had worse baseline mental health—and therefore sought the medication to help—than the other post-menopausal group. While the researchers don’t know whether the individuals on HRT would have experienced more severe mental health problems without it, the treatment isn’t considered effective for anxiety or depression, they write in the paper.\nThe brain regions implicated in the study may also provide key insights into Alzheimer’s disease, which women are twice as likely to develop as men. The results suggest that menopause is associated with less gray matter volume in areas including the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, which are important for learning and memory, Sahakian says on the BBC’s Global News Podcast.\n“Those are two of the first areas to be affected by the changes that we see in Alzheimer’s disease,” she says. “So, it does seem that the menopause might make the female brain more vulnerable.”",

          "content": "Some lessons are timeless: poke the bear, push your luck, stir the potâ¦and now they have a social-mediaâfriendly shorthand: âfafo.â Most people get the gistâmeddle too much, and youâll face the consequences. You donât even need to say the full expletive to make your warning known. But how did this four-word punchline go from casual slang to viral internet sensation? Letâs find out.\n\"Fafo\" Defined\nYou donât have to mess around to find out what \"fafo\" means. The phrase is exactly what it sounds like: f*** around, find out. Itâs a blunt warning wrapped in an acronym, often used to signal that actions have consequencesâsometimes humorously, sometimes not.\nAs Merriam-Webster defines it, part of the appeal of \"fafo\" is its schadenfreude factor: thereâs a certain satisfaction in watching someone discover the consequences of their own risky choices.\nOnline, \"fafo\" shows up in memes, comment sections, and captions as shorthand for proceed at your own risk. Depending on the context, it can come off as tongue-in-cheek or genuinely cautionary, but the message is always the same: push your luck, and youâll see what happens.\nWhere \"Fafo\" Came From\nâFafoâ may feel like a product of online culture, but it has deeper roots than memes suggest. Like many slang terms, the phrase can be traced back to African American Vernacular English (AAVE), with The Washington Post noting its use as early as 2007. One of the earliest mentions on Urban Dictionary links âfafoâ to biker slang, where it served as a warning that reckless behavior comes with consequences.\nOver time, the acronym moved from these niche communities into broader conversation, eventually popping up in political discourseâand, naturally, plenty of internet beef.\n\"Fafo\" on the FYP\nLook up #fafo on TikTok, and youâll find everything from daring stunts to quick political commentary. The phrase saw a major spike in 2022 after Elon Musk tweeted it following a controversy with Kanye West, sending users scrambling to figure out what it meant. Around the same time, TikTok user Roger Skaer posted a âfafo chartâ showing just how much someone has to \"f*** around\" to \"find out\"âand the video went viral, racking up millions of views in a matter of days.\nIn the months leading up to the 2024 election, supporters on both sides used the acronym to signal the potential consequences of voting choices. After the results, creators continued using âfafoâ to highlight the fallout from controversial policiesâfrom rising healthcare costs and trade disputes to family tensions sparked by politics.\n\"Fafo\" IRL\nIf your âFor You Pageâ has started to feel a lot like the front page of the news, youâre not imagining it. \"Fafo\" has jumped off screens and into real life, appearing in politics, pop culture, and high-profile social media posts. Public figures, including the president, have started using the acronym in high-stakes moments to make a point. In November 2024, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner dropped a censored version of \"fafo\" to warn against election interference. Shortly after, former Congressman Bakari Sellers used it on CNN to caution that voters who underestimated President Trumpâs policies would quickly âfind outâ the consequences. Military officials have even spelled it out in briefings, signaling the serious stakes for risky decisions.\nThe phrase has also popped up in pop culture. In early 2025, Kylie Kelce went viral talking about âfafo\" parenting on her podcast, sharing stories of letting her daughter face the consequences of her choices instead of stepping in at every turn. Think of it as letting kids âtest the waters and find outââwhether thatâs feeling the chill of skipping a jacket or seeing what happens when homework gets forgotten. Kelceâs take was so popular it spawned a YouTube spinoff and even âfafoâ-themed merch, proving that this four-letter warning isnât just for stunts and politics.\nAnd \"fafo\" has officially gone global. In January 2026, the White House posted a stark black-and-white image of President Trump featuring the acronym after the capture of Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. A phrase born online was now being used to signal real-world consequences, showing just how far four letters can travel.",

          "content": "The Mystery of the Missing Robert Burns Painting Has Finally Been Solved—After 200 Years of Searches and Seances\nThe portrait of the renowned Scottish poet vanished without a trace in 1840. Since then, scholars and sleuths alike have been strategizing about how to get it back\nIn 1802, six years after the death of Robert Burns, who is known as Scotland’s greatest poet, the painter Henry Raeburn was commissioned to create a portrait that would preserve the writer’s likeness.\nLittle did Raeburn know that the job, for which he was paid 20 guineas, would ignite a centuries-long mystery.\nThe portrait was commissioned by the London publishers Cadell and Davies, who wanted an image to pair with future editions of his collected poems. Raeburn painted Burns based on the only portrait the poet had ever sat for: a small oval painting by Alexander Nasmyth, completed in 1787.\nQuick fact: Robert Burns’ enduring legacy\nThe Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger and Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck both have titles that were inspired by the Scottish poet’s work.\nUsing Nasmyth’s piece as a guide, Raeburn finished his own, larger interpretation in 1803, though it wasn’t engraved for print until 1820. Then, after the publishing house shuttered in 1840, the painting disappeared. Its nearly 200-year disappearance has inspired speculation and spirited searching from amateur sleuths and esteemed scholars alike.\n“Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, reported about a seance that happened where a crazy Burns collector named Edward Barrington Nash tried through the medium of a spirit to invoke Robert Burns and find where this missing portrait was,” William Zachs, a Burns scholar and director of the Blackie House Library and Museum in Edinburgh, tells BBC News’ Pauline McLean.\nIn 1924, TCF Brotchie, the director of Glasgow Art Galleries and Museums, wrote that the discovery of the painting would be “an event bordering upon the sensational,” per a statement from the University of Glasgow.\nLast March, keen-eyed observers were drawn to a house clearance sale held by Wimbledon Auctions, a London-based auction house. Its 100th lot featured a painting described as “Robert Burns in the manner of Raeburn,” according to a statement from the University of Edinburgh.\nPhotographs appeared to fit descriptions of the long-lost work. Though the piece was expected to sell for between $400 and $700, eager bidders pushed its final price to around $113,000, reports the New York Times’ Precious Adesina.\nThe winner was Zachs, who also owns a letter that details the decision to commission Raeburn. That correspondence is one of roughly 40,000 items in Zachs’ collection connected to Burns.\nOnce the coveted painting was in his possession, Zachs consulted with a variety of experts, all of whom confirmed the piece was indeed the sought-after original. Its twill weave canvas and small dabs of red pigment in each layer—both characteristic of Raeburn’s works—were key features that helped confirm the painting’s authenticity, according to the Times.\n“Raeburn’s expressive, seemingly effortless brushwork, the characteristic warm palette, soft, atmospheric lighting and sensitive rendering of the instantly recognizable Robert Burns are a joy,” says Lesley Stevenson, a senior conservator of paintings at the National Galleries of Scotland, in a statement.\nZachs took the piece, which had yellowed over the years, to a London studio where it could be restored. There, experts made another discovery: The painting had already been restored about 100 years ago.\nAt the National Galleries of Scotland, Raeburn’s portrait of Burns is now on public display for the first time. It’s positioned right beside the Nasmyth piece that served as its template.\nThe exhibition is timed to coincide with Burns Night on January 25, which is a day of national celebration across Scotland. Lines from the poet’s most famous poems—such as “A Red, Red Rose” (1794) and “Auld Lang Syne” (1788)—are recited, bagpipe music abounds, and haggis, Scotland’s national dish, are eaten.\n“Although Raeburn was working from an image made by another painter, the portrait has that wonderful freshness of observation that marks Raeburn’s work at its best,” Duncan Thomson, former keeper of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, says in the National Galleries of Scotland statement. “The result is a portrait that speaks in an entirely new way of the warmth, the sensuality and the profound intelligence that we find in Burns’ poetry.”",

          "content": "See the Most Detailed Map of Dark Matter Ever Made, Bringing Astronomers a Step Closer to Unraveling Its Mysterious Nature\nThe invisible stuff makes up about 85 percent of all matter in the universe, but researchers know little about it\nThanks to NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), researchers have mapped dark matter in extraordinary detail, which could help them solve some of the most puzzling cosmic mysteries.\nDark matter—the strange, invisible stuff that makes up most of the universe’s matter—is notoriously hard to chart because it doesn’t reflect, absorb or emit any light. Instead, scientists rely on its gravitational influence to deduce where it is. The new map, published in the journal Nature Astronomy on January 26, offers an unprecedented look at how dark matter interacts with the rest of the universe.\n“It’s the gravitational scaffolding into which everything else falls and is built into galaxies. And we can actually see that process happening in this map,” says study co-author Richard Massey, a physicist at Durham University in England, to Elizabeth Landau at National Geographic.\nThe objects that we can see—planets, stars, people—are made of what’s called ordinary matter. But this stuff makes up merely 15 percent of the matter in the universe. The rest is the mysterious dark matter, a substance that researchers have been trying to understand for the past century. They suspect that it acts as glue, keeping the universe together, and knowing where it’s located will help reveal information about the universe’s history and how the cosmos is organized.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope previously helped researchers map dark matter within a well-studied portion of the sky known as the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, which is about the size of two and a half full moons, per a statement. But that was made nearly 20 years ago.\nTo create an updated, higher-resolution version, JWST spent about 255 hours in 2023 and 2024 looking at the same region. “The James Webb Space Telescope is like putting on a new pair of glasses for the universe,” says study co-author Diana Scognamiglio, a cosmologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to Will Dunham at Reuters.\n“It sees fainter and more distant galaxies with much sharper detail than ever before,” which also provides a “denser grid of background galaxies,” she tells the outlet. “More galaxies and sharper images translate directly into a sharper map of dark matter.”\nThe researchers searched for the mysterious substance by examining how clumps of it warp light emitted by far-off galaxies before the rays reach JWST, a technique called gravitational lensing. “The galaxies, or whatever we’re looking at, get bent into these characteristic shapes, like a funhouse mirror,” Massey explains to National Geographic. “And we work out how much dark matter there is by figuring out how it distorted the shapes of these background galaxies.”\nThanks to JWST, Massey, Scognamiglio and their colleagues generated a dark matter map more than twice the resolution of Hubble’s. It also contains nearly 800,000 galaxies—around twice as many as the older one, per the statement.\nFun fact: More dark matter observations incoming\nWhile JWST looked at a small portion of the sky, more observatories will soon help researchers generate larger dark matter maps. For instance, NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope—planned to launch by May 2027—will chart the strange stuff across an area about 4,400 times that of the COSMOS region, though its map won’t be as high-resolution as JWST’s.\nThe researchers hope that their map will lead to a better understanding of dark matter’s role in the universe. The map is not only “an observational coup, but in turn, it’s going to enable a lot of other analysis—cosmological parameter constraints, the connection between galaxies and their dark matter haloes and how they grow and evolve over time,” says study co-author Jacqueline McCleary, an observational cosmologist at Northeastern University, to Leah Crane at New Scientist.\nRachel Mandelbaum, a physicist at Carnegie Mellon University who was not involved in the work, echoes that sentiment. She tells National Geographic that future research based on the map may help scientists understand the distribution of galaxies and why some regions of space are relatively sparse.\nThat kind of work “will help us answer our basic questions about the universe,” she adds.",

          "content": "Archaeologists Say This 9,500-Year-Old Burial Is the Oldest Known Evidence of Intentional Cremation Discovered in Africa\nLocated in Malawi, the site could also be the world’s earliest example of an in situ cremation pyre for an adult, according to a new study\nA large mound of ash containing burned bone fragments has been discovered in Malawi. The remains belonged to a Stone Age woman, and experts think the site could be the oldest known cremation pyre found in Africa, according to a study published this month in the journal Science Advances.\n“Cremation is very rare among ancient and modern hunter-gatherers, at least partially because pyres require a huge amount of labor, time and fuel to transform a body into fragmented and calcined bone and ash,” says lead author Jessica Cerezo-Román, an anthropologist at the University of Oklahoma, in a statement.\nThe researchers found the ashes at Mount Hora in northern Malawi. Study co-author Jessica Thompson, an anthropologist at Yale University, tells NPR’s Nell Greenfieldboyce that hunter-gatherers camped, hunted, lit fires and buried their dead within the rocky shelters at the mountain’s base.\nIn the 1950s, researchers first discovered that a site known as Hora 1, located beneath a stone overhang at the base of the mountain, was once a hunter-gatherer burial ground. Thompson has been studying the site since 2016, and her research suggested that humans first inhabited Hora 1 about 21,000 years ago. They used the site to bury their dead between about 16,000 and 8,000 years ago, though these burials were complete skeletons.\nAs such, researchers were surprised when recent excavations revealed a layer of ash as large as a queen-size bed. The cremation burial contained the remains of one woman, though her skull was missing.\n“There is something really unusual about either this person in life or this person in death,” co-author Elizabeth Sawchuk, the curator of human evolution at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, tells NPR. “Whether something positive, whether something negative, we just don’t know, but that’s also what makes this discovery really spectacular.”\nUsing radiocarbon dating, the researchers determined the cremation occurred about 9,500 years ago. They then analyzed the burned bones using forensic and bioarchaeological techniques, write Cerezo-Román, Thompson and Sawchuk in the Conversation. Evidence suggests the remains likely belong to a middle-aged woman. She was just under five feet tall, though she appears to have been physically active before her death.\nMicroscopic incisions on the skeleton’s arms and legs indicate that some of the woman’s flesh may have been removed before or during the cremation. However, according to the Conversation, “Patterns of warping, cracks and discoloration caused by fire damage showed her body was burned with some flesh still on it.” The researchers think that large amounts of wood and grass were gathered for the fire, which they estimate would have reached at least 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\nHowever, the archaeologists are still baffled by many details of the site. “What keeps me up at 2 a.m. is, where is her head?” Sawchuk tells NPR.\nBecause humans’ dense skull bones usually preserve well in cremations, the researchers hypothesize that the woman’s head was removed, perhaps as part of a funerary ritual, per the Conversation. The woman’s bones were found in two clusters, suggesting her body was moved during the cremation.\n“There is no evidence to suggest that they were doing any kind of violent act or cannibalism to the remains,” Cerezo-Román says to the Guardian’s Nicola Davis. Instead, as Sawchuk tells the publication, “some of the missing bones from the cremated woman may have been deliberately removed and taken as tokens for curation or reburial elsewhere.”\nThis discovery is also unique for its age, write the researchers. The world’s oldest known evidence of cremation is a roughly 40,000-year-old burial found at Lake Mungo in Australia. However, the earliest known in situ funeral pyre containing human remains is in Alaska, where a young child was buried around 11,500 years ago.\nQuick fact: The cremation at Lake Mungo\nDiscovered in 1968, this roughly 40,000-year-old burial represents “one of the earliest anatomically modern human remains discovered anywhere in the world,” according to the National Museum of Australia.\nBefore the new discovery, the earliest known evidence of burned human remains in Africa dated back around 7,500 years, and the continent’s oldest confirmed cremations are about 3,300 years old. According to a statement, the newly discovered site “provides the earliest evidence of intentional cremation in Africa and describes the world’s oldest known in situ cremation pyre containing the remains of an adult.”\nThe discovery also offers new insights into hunter-gatherer communities. The researchers estimate that humans used at least 66 pounds of deadwood and grass to cremate the woman at Hora 1, stoking the fire for hours or days. Additionally, radiocarbon dating of ash samples showed that this “was not the first fire at the Hora 1 site—nor its last,” per the Conversation. “While there is no evidence that anyone else was cremated in the subsequent fires, the fact that people repeatedly returned to the spot for this purpose suggests its significance lived on in community memory.”\nIn hunter-gatherer communities, evidence of such attachment to land across generations is rare. The researchers hope that additional excavations in the area will help them determine why one woman was singled out and why the ritual was meaningful to her community.\n“That it is such an early date, and that they would have been transient as hunter-gatherers makes it more amazing,” Joel Irish, an anthropologist and archaeologist at England’s Liverpool John Moores University who wasn’t involved in the study, tells the Guardian. “They clearly had advanced belief systems and a high level of social complexity at this early date.”",
